    The DeskCycle is especially great for seniors as it puts less tension on the body. It is usually kept under the desk while paddling; This gives you a healthy exercise while performing other activities such as watching movies, using your phone, reading a book,  playing games or even operating a laptop over the desk without much disturbance from the bike.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reviews have been made on how silent the bike is, some buyers even said they had forgotten they were paddling when working.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though the DeskCycle might not give you a heavy workout experience, it will certainly help improve your health, energy-level and productivity.   Pedaling the DeskCycle at a leisurely pace of 1 revolution per second on the lowest resistance setting doesn't feel like exercise at all. Yet this will increase your Calories burnt more than using a standing desk. 
  </p>
  <p>
    On a setting of 3 at the same pace, you will burn twice the amount of Calories than you would just sitting at your desk. When using the DeskCycle at your desk you should set the resistance level to 3 or less. This low cardio zone increases your energy level and oxygen to your brain without distracting you from your work.
  </p>
  <p class="drawback p-3">
    This bike might perform a lot of wonders, but it is not recommended for a strong session. If you are looking for something to increase the work load you can check from the other bikes on our list for something stronger.

    	    B)Align the bolts of the Large Leg with the holes in the Bike, and push the bolts through the holes. <br>
	        C)Attach a Washer and a Nut to each bolt. 
      </p>

      <b>TIP 1. PEDAL DOWNWARD (MOST IMPORTANT!!!)</b>
      <p>
        The most important advice we can give you is to pedal downward. This will keep the bike in place. If the bike moves around, then you are not pedaling downward.
      </p>
      <b>How to Pedal Correctly</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Start pushing down on the pedal when the pedal arm is around the 1 o’clock position (just past the highest pedal position).
        </li>
        <li>
          Stop applying force to the pedal when it’s at the lowest position.
        </li>
        <li>
          You should pedal downward throughout this range as shown by the arrows in the picture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Point your toes forward on the downward stroke. This keeps your heels from hitting the floor or the rear leg.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>TIP 2. START OUT SLOW; LISTEN TO YOUR BODY</b>
      <p>
        Start out at the minimum resistance (level 1) and pedal the bike at 10 to 15mph. This will give you time to get used to pedaling downward. For those who don’t ride a bike regularly, it will give also you a chance to get your muscles used to using a bike. Increase the resistance as you get used to the bike.
      </p>
      <b>TIP 3. KEEP YOUR UPPER BODY STILL</b>
      <p>
        Keeping your body still makes it easy to focus on your work. Your head should not move when pedaling the bike.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pedal with your legs, not your body.</li>
        <li>Don't rock from side to side.</li>
        <li>Pedaling downward makes it easier to keep your upper body still</li>
      </ul>
      <b>TIP 4. SIT UP STRAIGHT</b>
      <p>
        Don’t slouch. Sit up straight. Sitting up straight while using the DeskCycle will help strengthen your core. It’s also good for your spine.
      </p>
      <b>TIP 5. KEEP YOUR BACK SUPPORTED</b>
      <p>
        If your chair seat is too deep, you may need to sit towards the front of your chair in order to use the bike. In this case you can place a lumbar cushion behind your back for support. You can find these on Amazon.
      </p>
      <b>TIP 6. EXTEND YOUR LEGS</b>
      <p>
        When the pedals are at their farthest point, your legs should be bent at about 25 to 30 degrees from fully extended. This is healthiest for your knees.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your desk is short or if you are tall, your knees may hit the underside of your desk when you pedal the bike. Below are some tips that will lower your knees. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lower your chair. This can lower your knees by several inches. In most cases this is all you need to do.
        </li>
        <li>
          Point your toes upward on the upward pedal stroke. When your toes are pointing upward, your knees will be lower by an inch or two. Then point your toes forward on the downward pedal stroke. This will exercise your calves as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Move the bike farther away from you and extend your legs more. Extending your legs lowers your knees. You may not be able to do this if your desk is not very deep underneath.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Guidelines For Pedaling While Typing.</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Keep the resistance low. A setting of 3 or less will work for most people.
        </li>
        <li>
          Find a pedal speed that’s comfortable. 15mph or less is a good target.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep your upper body still. See TIP 3.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sit up straight. See TIP 4.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep your back supported. See TIP 5.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Other Opportunities to Use the Bike</b>
      <p>Use the DeskCycle while sitting,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At your desk, 
        </li>

  <h4>Step 1:</h4>
  <p>
    Unpack the product. When doing this, make sure the box is in the right upright position before taking out the product. This is to ensure the product doesn’t fall upside down the package
  </p>
  <h4>Step 2:</h4>
  <p>
    The content of the package should include the bike body/bicycle unit (partly arranged part), the floor stands, tool kit (all the necessary screw, nut, bolt, washers etc needed for assembly), the seat, handle bars, the support column/bracket and the pedals. All these should be properly identified for the next step.
  </p>
  <h4>Step 3:</h4>
  <p>
    Attach the main floor stand (the one which has wheels) to the bicycle unit with the tools (bolts, washers, and nuts) provided. Make sure the nuts are well tightened.
  </p>
  <h4>Step 4:</h4>
  <p>
    Attach the pedals to the body of the bike. This should be easy, just align the nut on the pedal to the hole on the body unit where the pedal should be and then join the two terminals. Afterwards, screw the connection point in a clockwise movement with your hand. Then tighten properly with the provided tool.
  </p>
  <p>
    Repeat the same process on the other pedal part. You will have to screw the other part in an anticlockwise manner depending on which part you start first or your angle of installation.
  </p>
  <h4>Step 5:</h4>
  <p>
    There should be two long support brackets present in the package, the handle bar support bracket for the front and the seat support bracket for the rear end. Insert and tighten them into their respective positions by loosing and tightening the knobs provided below their respective posts.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is also an additional support bracket provided in the package. This is the shortest of the three and it is meant to hold the handle bar. Attach it on top of the front support bracket (after installation on the bicycle unit) and screw with the knob provided.
  </p>
  <h4>Step 6:</h4>
  <p>
    Attach the handle bar on top of it support bracket using the screws (bolts, nuts etc) provided and tighten.
  </p>
  <h4>Step 7:</h4>
  <p>
    Now it is time to insert the control unit. First ensure that the batteries are put in place and then align the control unit with the bike body by attaching it to the handle bar. Then attach the connection cord from the bike body up to the control unit
  </p>
  <h4>Step 8:</h4>
  <p>
    Insert the handle bar cover plate. Apply pressure with your hands by pushing or hitting to fit it into place.
  </p>
  <h4>Step 9:</h4>
  <p>
    Finally attach the seat to the bike body. Do this by mounting it on the support bracket at the rear end of the bike body and tighten proper. That’s all, your Yosuda Cycling Bike is ready for workouts

    They don’t just deal with exercise bikes the company is also a big deal when it comes to outdoor bikes. You can guess from the name that they are the brains behind this awesome bike as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    So you could say like most of our bikes, the Schwinn 170 also has a reputable company backing it, rest assure it does stand out. Now let’s dive in
  </p>
  <p>
    The schwinn 170 upright bike is a good value for many beginners as it is budget friendly but also includes all the basic features and more needed for a healthy workout session. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It comes packing with a lot of great features including 29 on-board workout programs, eight RideSocial mobile app routes, wireless telemetry, a sound system for MP3s, an online goal tracker, a large fully padded adjustable seat, angle adjustable handlebars with forearm rests for a comfortable riding position, ergonomically placed grip heart rate sensors for a relaxed riding position when using a heart rate program, adjustable 3-speed fan to keep you cool while exercising, a water bottle holder to keep you hydrated while you burn some calorie, a strong 3-piece crank system and oversized pedals. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The 29 workout programs which comes along with this beauty are easily adjusted based on your preferences. You can place a goal on the number of calories you wish to burn, the distance or amount of miles you want to cover and how much time you want to spend working out daily. You could also create a profile which saves data on you and all your workout sessions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Last but not the least the resistance system. I don’t think this review would make much sense if I don’t talk about the 25 level of eddy current magnetic resistance installed on this machine which I found quite amusing myself. 
  </p>
  <p>
    These resistance levels are built for a wide range of cycler, allow using you to adjust the level of difficulty based on your level which could on expert or beginner. Just in case you want to test out your stamina or strength you could also adjust these resistance levels based on your preferences.
  </p>
  <p class="caution p-3">
    Some customers have made some complains about receiving defective parts, this might be due to mishandling during shipping. Of course it can easily resolve by contacting the customer service. They should send a replacement, but waiting for these parts to arrive could be a headache

  <h3 class="mb-4">Features</h3>
  <h4>Workout Programs</h4>
  <p>
    Comes loaded with 29 workout programs, 4 user settings and goal tracking are all there to keep you motivated and challenged
  </p>
  <h4>25 Levels of Eddy Current Resistance</h4>
  <p>
    25 levels of resistance aligned with a high speed high inertia perimeter weighted flywheel make every workout smooth and quiet. This great resistance system, allows you to adjust the level of difficulty when pedaling based on your needs and preferences
  </p>
  <h4>Usb Charging Port</h4>
  <p>
    Has a charging usb port which could also be used for data transfer especially when creating profile and saving progress
  </p>
  <h4>Console</h4>
  <p>
    The DualTrack console is a great addition  to this machine. The computer/console has two backlit screen and two displays which both show data from your workout session; One is responsible for the statistics of the current session, while the other column shows you your progress of the goals you have set in your profile. You can actually create up to 4 user profiles so that several members of your family can track their own progress. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to the backlit, these data can easily be seen in dim light also. The console can also be adjusted for a personalized ergonomic fit. Another great feature of the console is it Bluetooth connectivity which allows you to transfer your workout data through Schwinn ConnectTM or MyFitnessPal, making it easier to track your performance. 
  </p>
  <h4>Large Pedals</h4>
  <p>
    The pedals are oversized for comfort and have adjustable straps. There is also room for customization, owners can decide to switch out the pedals for SPD compatible pedals or any standard road bike pedals.
  </p>
  <h4>Adjustable Cushioned Seat</h4>
  <p>
    The Schwinn 170 supports a contoured seat and an ergonomically placed grip, which allows your body to be in a relaxed riding position. The seat is adjusted and well cushioned for comfort, but if the rider doesn’t like it, it can be exchanged with any standard bicycle seat.
  </p>
  <h4>MP3 Speakers</h4>
  <p>
    Who wouldn’t appreciate some good music while working out? it’s good for the mood and make your workout session more productive. I have to give a thumbs up to Schwinn for thinking about this. They added a pair of acoustic chamber speakers which will surely give pretty decent quality sound while you exercise
  </p>
  <h4>Water Bottle Holder</h4>
  <p>

        Hardware is pre-installed on the stabilizers and not on Hardware Card. Make sure transport wheels on the front stabilizer point forward, and the Schwinn® decal on the rear stabilizer faces outward from the machine
      </p>
      <b>Step 2: Install Console Mast, Mast Gasket and Top Shroud on Main Assembly</b><br>
      <p>
        Make sure the Console Cable connector does not fall into the Console Mast. Align the clips on the cable connectors and make sure the connectors lock. Do not crimp Console Cable. Be sure the tabs on the Top Shroud snap into the Main Assembly
      </p>
      <b>Step 3: Install Handlebars on Console Mast</b>
      <p>
        Do not crimp the cables. Put the Handlebar in the bracket, adjust the Handlebar to the desired angle, and install the T-handle through the holes.

    <h2>8. <a href="">Exerpeutic 900XL Weight Capacity Recumbent Exercise Bike</a></h2>
    <p>
      Recumbent bikes are often a common choice when it comes to exercise bikes, and there are no surprises there as to why this is so. Though they might not burn as much calories as upright bike, they are more than enough for a daily workout.

  <p>
    Recumbent bikes ease the tension on the kneels and joints when pedaling, they also tend to be an excellent option for people with physical limitations, such as lower back injuries/pain or neurological conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    While still offering a challenging workout, recumbent bikes put the rider into a more comfortable, natural reclined body position with a seat that cradles the lower body and encourages better spinal posture. Thus giving a form of relaxation during workouts
  </p>
  <p>
    The Exerpeutic Weight Capacity Recumbent Exercise Bike is one of our top choices of recumbent bikes. Just like the Marcy Recumbent Bike which we spoke of earlier in this article, this Exerpeutic Bike is also a beauty to have with you.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Exerpeutic 900XL is an entry level recumbent bike which is budget friendly and very appealing to most users. The bike might not come with a lot of fancy features, but it has just enough to make you break a sweat and ask for more. It features a sturdy design and a solid weight construction of 300lbs for smooth operation. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Another great feature of this bike is it silent operation which creates less noise in your workout environment and of course allows you to engage in other recreational activities such as listening to songs or watching exercise sessions on the TV which helps improve your workout.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Exerpeutic 900XL also comes with a heart rate sensor in the handgrip which enables you to track the intensity of your session. It has a step through design which makes it very easy for users to get off and on the bike during and after their session. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The heart rate sensors coupled with other cool features such as the oversized pedal and the large, padded adjustable seat help create an excellent cardiovascular workout session right in the comfort of your home.
  </p>
  <div class="caution p-3">
    <p>
      The Exerpeutic  900Xl does sound like an awesome bike and it is one of course, but you should keep in mind that it is a very low priced product and as such you shouldn’t expect much of the fancy features you would often see on mid to high end recumbent bike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users have also made complains on the flexibility of the seats. Though they do provide comfort when well place, they can be very hard to adjust. The knobs are quite a pain to play with. Although this might not be a problem if only one person is using the machine, once you get it right the first time there would no reason to readjust. 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if there are multiple users involved this could be frustrating as each would want to readjust the seat to their preference during their sessions.
      You should note also that this is a recumbent bike and while they are great for cardios, they aren’t really recommended for a heavy calorie burning workout
    </p>

  </div>
  <h3 class="mb-4">Features</h3>
  <h4>Step Through Design (easy to get on and off)</h4>
  <p>
    Step-Thru design providing very easy on and off capability which results in a more effective and comfortable workout. This makes it easy for all users to get on the bike for use and when they are done they can get off the same way as well.
  </p>
  <h4>300 Pounds Weight Capacity</h4>
  <p>
    This bike comes with an extended weight support of up to 300lb. Thus increasing the scope of users that can make use of it
  </p>
  <h4>8 Level Magnetic Tension System</h4>
  <p>
    The bike also comes with an eight level resistance tension system. This makes it suitable for all types of cycler, ranging from novice to expert. The eight tension system can easily be adjusted to give a more realistic riding experience. As the tension level increases, the higher the difficulty during paddling and thus the more calories burnt during cycling. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition the Smooth torque” cranking system provides a smooth and consistent pedaling motion. These also help create a silent environment when working out which helps you engage in other recreational activities. 
  </p>
  <h4>LCD Computer</h4>
  <p>
    Well don’t expect to see anything fancy in this department. The exerpeutic 900XL doesn’t include workout programs and the likes on it console. However, the low cost stationary bike does have simple and elegant 3. 5” LCD display which is easy to read and understand. The large window LCD display indicates distance, calories burned, time, speed, pulse and scan.
  </p>
  <h4>Transportation Wheels</h4>
  <p>
    Transportation wheel also comes with this bike for easy movement during storage and for placing in the right spot when it time for some workout
  </p>
  <h4>Precision Balanced Flywheel</h4>
  <p>
    Heavy duty steel frame construction with extended Weight Capacity for stability and smooth operation. The precision balanced flywheel and V- belt drive provide a smooth and quiet operation
  </p>
  <h4>Handgrip Heart Rate Sensor</h4>
  <p>
    Hand Pulse provides for heart rate monitoring giving you a great cardio workout. This is a great feature and isn’t one you would expect to see on a low cost bike so a big thumbs to exerpeutic. The heart rate sensor lets you know the intensity of your workout. That is you get to keep track of how much effort you are putting in and of course if you need to put in more or rather if you are already going at a great pace. 
  </p>
  <h4>Extended Leg Stabilizers</h4>
  <p>
    Leg stabilizers prevent any movement when exercising
  </p>
  <h4>Large Padded Seat</h4>
  <p>
    The bike may be low cost, but I must admit the manufacturers did put a lot of effort in the padded seats, both the one below and the one for the back comfort. Not only is the seat base and back support well padded, the seat is very large to increase the level of comfort while paddling. It also relieves your back and joints from pains.
