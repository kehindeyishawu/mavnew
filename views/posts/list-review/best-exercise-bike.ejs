    The DeskCycle is especially great for seniors as it puts less tension on the body. It is usually kept under the desk while paddling; This gives you a healthy exercise while performing other activities such as watching movies, using your phone, reading a book,  playing games or even operating a laptop over the desk without much disturbance from the bike.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reviews have been made on how silent the bike is, some buyers even said they had forgotten they were paddling when working.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though the DeskCycle might not give you a heavy workout experience, it will certainly help improve your health, energy-level and productivity.   Pedaling the DeskCycle at a leisurely pace of 1 revolution per second on the lowest resistance setting doesn't feel like exercise at all. Yet this will increase your Calories burnt more than using a standing desk. 
  </p>
  <p>
    On a setting of 3 at the same pace, you will burn twice the amount of Calories than you would just sitting at your desk. When using the DeskCycle at your desk you should set the resistance level to 3 or less. This low cardio zone increases your energy level and oxygen to your brain without distracting you from your work.
  </p>
  <p class="drawback p-3">
    This bike might perform a lot of wonders, but it is not recommended for a strong session. If you are looking for something to increase the work load you can check from the other bikes on our list for something stronger.

      <b>Step 1: Install the Large Leg</b>
      <p>
          A)Remove the nuts and washers from the Large Leg. <br>
    	    B)Align the bolts of the Large Leg with the holes in the Bike, and push the bolts through the holes. <br>
	        C)Attach a Washer and a Nut to each bolt. 
      </p>
      <p>
        (Note: Do NOT tighten the nuts until step 3.)
      </p>
      <b>Step 2: Install the Small Leg</b><br>
      <p>
        A)Remove the nuts and washers from the Small Leg. <br>
        B)Align the bolts of the Small Leg with the holes in the Bike, and push the bolts through the holes. <br>
        C)Attach a Washer and a Nut to each bolt. 
      </p>
      <p>
        (Note: Do NOT tighten the nuts until step 3.)
      </p>
      <b>Step 3:Level the Bike & Tighten Nuts</b>
      <p>

      <b>TIP 1. PEDAL DOWNWARD (MOST IMPORTANT!!!)</b>
      <p>
        The most important advice we can give you is to pedal downward. This will keep the bike in place. If the bike moves around, then you are not pedaling downward.
      </p>
      <b>How to Pedal Correctly</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Start pushing down on the pedal when the pedal arm is around the 1 o’clock position (just past the highest pedal position).
        </li>
        <li>
          Stop applying force to the pedal when it’s at the lowest position.
        </li>
        <li>
          You should pedal downward throughout this range as shown by the arrows in the picture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Point your toes forward on the downward stroke. This keeps your heels from hitting the floor or the rear leg.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>TIP 2. START OUT SLOW; LISTEN TO YOUR BODY</b>
      <p>
        Start out at the minimum resistance (level 1) and pedal the bike at 10 to 15mph. This will give you time to get used to pedaling downward. For those who don’t ride a bike regularly, it will give also you a chance to get your muscles used to using a bike. Increase the resistance as you get used to the bike.
      </p>
      <b>TIP 3. KEEP YOUR UPPER BODY STILL</b>
      <p>
        Keeping your body still makes it easy to focus on your work. Your head should not move when pedaling the bike.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pedal with your legs, not your body.</li>
        <li>Don't rock from side to side.</li>
        <li>Pedaling downward makes it easier to keep your upper body still</li>
      </ul>
      <b>TIP 4. SIT UP STRAIGHT</b>
      <p>
        Don’t slouch. Sit up straight. Sitting up straight while using the DeskCycle will help strengthen your core. It’s also good for your spine.
      </p>
      <b>TIP 5. KEEP YOUR BACK SUPPORTED</b>
      <p>
        If your chair seat is too deep, you may need to sit towards the front of your chair in order to use the bike. In this case you can place a lumbar cushion behind your back for support. You can find these on Amazon.
      </p>
      <b>TIP 6. EXTEND YOUR LEGS</b>
      <p>
        When the pedals are at their farthest point, your legs should be bent at about 25 to 30 degrees from fully extended. This is healthiest for your knees.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your desk is short or if you are tall, your knees may hit the underside of your desk when you pedal the bike. Below are some tips that will lower your knees. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lower your chair. This can lower your knees by several inches. In most cases this is all you need to do.
        </li>
        <li>
          Point your toes upward on the upward pedal stroke. When your toes are pointing upward, your knees will be lower by an inch or two. Then point your toes forward on the downward pedal stroke. This will exercise your calves as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Move the bike farther away from you and extend your legs more. Extending your legs lowers your knees. You may not be able to do this if your desk is not very deep underneath.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Guidelines For Pedaling While Typing.</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Keep the resistance low. A setting of 3 or less will work for most people.
        </li>
        <li>
          Find a pedal speed that’s comfortable. 15mph or less is a good target.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep your upper body still. See TIP 3.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sit up straight. See TIP 4.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep your back supported. See TIP 5.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Other Opportunities to Use the Bike</b>
      <p>Use the DeskCycle while sitting,</p>

  <p>
    These resistance levels are built for a wide range of cycler, allow using you to adjust the level of difficulty based on your level which could on expert or beginner. Just in case you want to test out your stamina or strength you could also adjust these resistance levels based on your preferences.
  </p>
  <p class="caution p-3">
    Some customers have made some complains about receiving defective parts, this might be due to mishandling during shipping. Of course it can easily resolve by contacting the customer service. They should send a replacement, but waiting for these parts to arrive could be a headache

  <p>
    The DualTrack console is a great addition  to this machine.

  </p>
  <h4>MP3 Speakers</h4>
  <p>
    Who wouldn’t appreciate some good music while working out? it’s good for the mood and make your workout session more productive. I have to give a thumbs up to Schwinn for thinking about this. They added a pair of acoustic chamber speakers which will surely give pretty decent quality sound while you exercise
  </p>

  <p>
    The Schwinn 170 operates quietly with low to no noise. This creates more room for entertainment, music or some TV
  </p>
  <h4>Transportation Wheels</h4>
  <p>
    Transportation wheels are also included, this makes it more easier to move the bike for storage or to your favorite spots for some good exercise.
  </p>
  <h4>Space Saving</h4>

      <p>
        Hardware is pre-installed on the stabilizers and not on Hardware Card. Make sure transport wheels on the front stabilizer point forward, and the Schwinn® decal on the rear stabilizer faces outward from the machine
      </p>
      <b>Step 2: Install Console Mast, Mast Gasket and Top Shroud on Main Assembly</b><br>
      <p>
        Make sure the Console Cable connector does not fall into the Console Mast. Align the clips on the cable connectors and make sure the connectors lock. Do not crimp Console Cable. Be sure the tabs on the Top Shroud snap into the Main Assembly
      </p>
      <b>Step 3: Install Handlebars on Console Mast</b>
      <p>
        Do not crimp the cables. Put the Handlebar in the bracket, adjust the Handlebar to the desired angle, and install the T-handle through the holes.

    <h2>8. <a href="">Exerpeutic 900XL Weight Capacity Recumbent Exercise Bike</a></h2>
    <p>
      Recumbent bikes are often a common choice when it comes to exercise bikes, and there are no surprises there as to why this is so. Though they might not burn as much calories as upright bike, they are more than enough for a daily workout. 
    </p>

  <p>
    Recumbent bikes ease the tension on the kneels and joints when pedaling, they also tend to be an excellent option for people with physical limitations, such as lower back injuries/pain or neurological conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    While still offering a challenging workout, recumbent bikes put the rider into a more comfortable, natural reclined body position with a seat that cradles the lower body and encourages better spinal posture. Thus giving a form of relaxation during workouts
  </p>
  <p>
    The Exerpeutic Weight Capacity Recumbent Exercise Bike is one of our top choices of recumbent bikes. Just like the Marcy Recumbent Bike which we spoke of earlier in this article, this Exerpeutic Bike is also a beauty to have with you.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Exerpeutic 900XL is an entry level recumbent bike which is budget friendly and very appealing to most users. The bike might not come with a lot of fancy features, but it has just enough to make you break a sweat and ask for more. It features a sturdy design and a solid weight construction of 300lbs for smooth operation. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Another great feature of this bike is it silent operation which creates less noise in your workout environment and of course allows you to engage in other recreational activities such as listening to songs or watching exercise sessions on the TV which helps improve your workout.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Exerpeutic 900XL also comes with a heart rate sensor in the handgrip which enables you to track the intensity of your session. It has a step through design which makes it very easy for users to get off and on the bike during and after their session. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The heart rate sensors coupled with other cool features such as the oversized pedal and the large, padded adjustable seat help create an excellent cardiovascular workout session right in the comfort of your home.
  </p>
  <div class="caution p-3">
    <p>
      The Exerpeutic  900Xl does sound like an awesome bike and it is one of course, but you should keep in mind that it is a very low priced product and as such you shouldn’t expect much of the fancy features you would often see on mid to high end recumbent bike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users have also made complains on the flexibility of the seats. Though they do provide comfort when well place, they can be very hard to adjust. The knobs are quite a pain to play with. Although this might not be a problem if only one person is using the machine, once you get it right the first time there would no reason to readjust. 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if there are multiple users involved this could be frustrating as each would want to readjust the seat to their preference during their sessions.
      You should note also that this is a recumbent bike and while they are great for cardios, they aren’t really recommended for a heavy calorie burning workout
    </p>

  </div>
  <h3 class="mb-4">Features</h3>
  <h4>Step Through Design (easy to get on and off)</h4>
  <p>
    Step-Thru design providing very easy on and off capability which results in a more effective and comfortable workout. This makes it easy for all users to get on the bike for use and when they are done they can get off the same way as well.
  </p>
  <h4>300 Pounds Weight Capacity</h4>
  <p>
    This bike comes with an extended weight support of up to 300lb. Thus increasing the scope of users that can make use of it
  </p>
  <h4>8 Level Magnetic Tension System</h4>
  <p>
    The bike also comes with an eight level resistance tension system. This makes it suitable for all types of cycler, ranging from novice to expert. The eight tension system can easily be adjusted to give a more realistic riding experience. As the tension level increases, the higher the difficulty during paddling and thus the more calories burnt during cycling. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition the Smooth torque” cranking system provides a smooth and consistent pedaling motion. These also help create a silent environment when working out which helps you engage in other recreational activities. 
  </p>
  <h4>LCD Computer</h4>
  <p>
    Well don’t expect to see anything fancy in this department. The exerpeutic 900XL doesn’t include workout programs and the likes on it console. However, the low cost stationary bike does have simple and elegant 3. 5” LCD display which is easy to read and understand. The large window LCD display indicates distance, calories burned, time, speed, pulse and scan.
  </p>
  <h4>Transportation Wheels</h4>
  <p>
    Transportation wheel also comes with this bike for easy movement during storage and for placing in the right spot when it time for some workout
  </p>
  <h4>Precision Balanced Flywheel</h4>
  <p>
    Heavy duty steel frame construction with extended Weight Capacity for stability and smooth operation. The precision balanced flywheel and V- belt drive provide a smooth and quiet operation
  </p>
  <h4>Handgrip Heart Rate Sensor</h4>
  <p>
    Hand Pulse provides for heart rate monitoring giving you a great cardio workout. This is a great feature and isn’t one you would expect to see on a low cost bike so a big thumbs to exerpeutic. The heart rate sensor lets you know the intensity of your workout. That is you get to keep track of how much effort you are putting in and of course if you need to put in more or rather if you are already going at a great pace. 
  </p>
  <h4>Extended Leg Stabilizers</h4>
  <p>
    Leg stabilizers prevent any movement when exercising
  </p>
  <h4>Large Padded Seat</h4>
  <p>
    The bike may be low cost, but I must admit the manufacturers did put a lot of effort in the padded seats, both the one below and the one for the back comfort. Not only is the seat base and back support well padded, the seat is very large to increase the level of comfort while paddling. It also relieves your back and joints from pains.

    From treadmills, elliptical trainers, upright and recumbent bikes, Schwinn offers tons of groundbreaking, smartly-designed innovations that are perfect for your home gym.
  </p>
  <p>
    I guess that’s why two of their products have made it to our Top 10 Exercise Bike review.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Schwinn 130 fitness bike provides a good cardiovascular workout so you can stay in shape and lose weight on a daily basis. It also has a strong tubular frame and a high-speed, high-inertia flywheel that provides that smooth outdoor cycling experience. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This top upright stationary bike helps to strengthen a user’s core muscles as they help stabilize a rider’s position on the bike and has a large contoured and padded seat along with adjustable handlebars to make sure you can get into a comfortable cycling position.   
  </p>
  <p>
    On top of the great cycling experience, the schwinn 130 is packed with a lot amazing features. It has a media shelf which can hold tablets, magazines or any other reading material that might aid your workout. A usb port is provided also, with a set of mp3 speakers so you could play some good music to keep you pumped while burning some calories. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It a has a DUALTRACK console which is loaded with 22 exercise programs, including 8 heart rate programs so you can do some cardio workout to burn out some fat and relieve some weight or stress.  
  </p>
  <p>
    The bike also has a 20 level resistance system, which isn’t something you see every day in an exercise bike of this class. This allows the bike to be accessible to a wide range of user as the difficulty level of the paddling can easily be adjusted to meet the needs and preferences of a variety of cycler. This would also help provide a realistic cycling experience in an indoor environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also comes with a goal tracking app which allows you set goal on your exercise and track your progress or how far you are from achieving those goals on your bike.
  </p>
  <div class="drawback p-3">
    <p>
      Customers have made complains about the comfort of the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      There have also been talks about the pedals of the bike. People with larger feat may find the bike difficult to use as their feet may not be well positioned. Also the pedals could be too close to the cranks for their legs, so they could hit it while pedaling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also has a 13lb flywheel which is not very encouraging in exercise bikes, as a heavier flywheel ensures smoother operation.

  <h3 class="mb-4">Features</h3>
  <h4>Usb Port</h4>
  <p>
    Comes with a usb port so you can easily charge your phones, tablets or any other electronics device that may assist you while you workout. The USB port can also be used to save your workout data into a flash drive which in turn can be saved into your Schwinn Connect account where you see your progress over time and share your data with MyFitness-Pal®.
  </p>
  <h4>MP3 Speakers</h4>
  <p>
    Music often helps with a daily workout routine. Schwinn probably thought of this which is why they decided to include a set of mp3 speakers to keep you pumped with some encouraging music while you burn off some steam.
  </p>
  <h4>Goal Track</h4>
  <p>
    Goal tracking capability enables users to set individual exercise goals like time, distance and calories. This helps track your progress and encourage you to do more.
  </p>
  <h4>Resistance</h4>
  <p>
    Comes with 20 levels of resistance for a wide range of workout intensity options. This is fitted for users with different strengths and helps give a realistic outdoor cycling experience.  
  </p>
  <h4>Adjustable Handbar</h4>
  <p>
    Adjustable angle, padded handlebars with contact heart rate monitors built within for a comfortable riding position
  </p>
  <h4>Streamlined Console</h4>
  <p>
    DualTrack LCD console screen displays 22 preset exercise programs offering increased visibility to programs and goal tracking. This console has two screens that display your workout data, but unfortunately it has no backlit like the upgraded version (Schwinn 170). It also has 8 custom heart rate programs that work with the ergonomically placed grip sensors on the handlebars which puts you in a relaxed riding position for some cardio exercise. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Another cool feature of the console is that users can easily transfer their workout data to MyFitnessPal or Schwinn ConnectTM, allowing you to track your workout progress on the go.
  </p>
  <h4>Sturdy Frame</h4>
  <p>
    The Schwinn 130 has a Sturdy steel frame which provides a stable workout platform with 2 integrated levelers.
  </p>
  <h4>3 Speed Fan</h4>
  <p>
    A cooling system installed to keep you cool and refreshed while padding on your new exercise bike. Another great feature that’s not very common on an exercise bike of this class.
  </p>
  <h4>Bottle Holder</h4>
  <p>
    The bike also comes with a bottle holder included. This helps hold your water bottle or water containers in a spot easily reachable when exercising. That way you always stay hydrated and refreshed no matter how intense your workout is.

  <h3 class="mt-5">Conclusion</h3>
  <div class="p-3 summary">
    <p>
      Intuitive and ergonomic, the Schwinn 130 is a good catch. The upright bike is loaded with user-friendly features for a cardio workout that's effective, comfortable and enjoyable. For a low cost bike it has a lot to offer, including a ton of workout programs and resistance levels to choose from.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it isn’t all that powerful. The biggest drawback is that it’s lacking in some of the more advanced features found in the 170, like telemetry heart rate monitoring and Bluetooth. That being said, before you make this purchase It wouldn’t be a bad idea if you checkout the Schwinn 170 bike which we talked about earlier in this article.
    </p>
    <p>
      For just a little extra cash, the Schwinn 170 is a similar bike to the 130, but with more upgraded features such as a fully adjustable seat, telemetry heart monitoring, backlit screens, Bluetooth connectivity, more resistance options, stronger crank and pedal. Whichever you choose to go for, you are not at a loss, the Schwinn 130 is more budget friendly and is more than enough to suit your workout needs.

      There is a lot I love about this bike. You could fall in love with it just by looking.

    A customer once said “I like the fact that I can watch TV, do my office work and it is easy to move this machine around”. Another buyer commented on how quiet the exercise bike is saying “This bike is so quiet, I could probably cycle right next to my sleeping toddler and not wake him up. Exactly what parents need, since nap time is the only serious exercise time!”
  </p>
  <p>
    From these feedbacks you can probably guess how good the desk bike really is, but just to clear out some of your doubts lets dive in some more.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Exerpeutic 2500 features 14 levels of magnetic resistance, a large 3 way adjustable desktop for your comfort and an airsoft seat that will be comfortable through all your workouts. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The oversized airsoft super cushioned seat is an upgrade from its previous version (i.e the exerpeutic exerwork 1000 ). This allows users to exercise for a much longer amount of time on this machine without any discomfort coming from down there
  </p>
  <p>
    Another nice feature of the 2500 is the three-way adjustable desktop. Not only does it adjust vertically and horizontally, but you can also change the tilt angle on it- which would come in handy if you were watching a tablet.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also comes with two water bottle holders built-in just to keep you refreshed and hydrated while you let off some weight.
  </p>
  <p>
    The free MyCloudFitness app gives you the ability to set workout goals, track your workouts, and settings for time, distance, and calories. 
  </p>
  <p>
    With the combination of all these features and many more, the Exerpeutic 2500 Desk Recumbent bike let you carry out your daily workouts while you work, read, play games or enjoy a movie. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Think of it more as exercising while doing what you love to do best. So why don’t you get started on your fitness goals today with the Exerpeutic 2500 ExerWork Bluetooth Desk Recumbent Bike.
  </p>
  <p>
    I should remind you guys that this is a recumbent bike, which means less strain is put on the knees and joints when pedaling. The bike will also be perfect for people who want less pressure on their back during workouts
  </p>
  <div class="caution p-3">
    <p>
      The only concern I have with the exerpeutic 2500 is that it only has a weight capacity of 250 lb, so it does not leave much room for a wider range of individuals. But if you do fit the size requirements and like fitness data tracking, the Exerpeutic 2500 is a good choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      There also has been complains about the shipping of the stationary bike as the arrival date can be vague. If you are buying from amazon, you should be aware that the bike is shipped in two packages which could arrive on different days. Assembling of bike could be a bit of a hassle also. It could take up to an hour or more to assemble.

  </div>
  <h3 class="mb-4">Features</h3>
  <h4>Step Through Design</h4>
  <p>
    The exerpeutic 2500 is perfectly designed in such a way that makes it very easy for users to get on the machine for workout and off when they are done with their session. That is to say it is very easy to get and off the bike as you please.
  </p>
  <h4>The Resistance System</h4>
  <p>
    The Exerpeutic 2500 Bluetooth 3 Way Adjustable Desk Recumbent Exercise Bike is equipped with a manual magnetic resistance system. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It features 14 resistance levels which is great for a variety of users. The higher the level of resistance is raised, the more intense the workout becomes. This is great for both users who wish to burn some heavy steam and those who just want a light workout.
  </p>
  <p>
    The resistance system is smooth and also quiet due to the fact that the magnetic brake and the flywheel which are the elements that generate the resistance do not make any direct contact with each other and so therefore no friction is generated. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The magnetic brake pad simply emits a magnetic field around the flywheel when the latter is in certain proximity in order to generate resistance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Quiet Drive belt system allows noiseless and uninterrupted workout sessions.
    Adjustable floor stabilizers are also present at the base for leveling to prevent the bike from rocking or tipping when cycling.
  </p>
  <h4>Durable and Stable Steel Frame Construction</h4>
  <p>
    Burn calories while you work. The Exerpeutic 2500 provides you with durable and solid frame construction which is made up of solid steel and while ABS material are used for other parts such as the shroud for the drive and the desk. It is sturdy enough to support 250 pounds/113 kg maximum user weight capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bike weighs about 70 pounds/31.7 kg which also boosts its overall stability. All the steel parts are coated with protective anti-corrosive and scratch paint that does the needful of ensuring that rusts do not invade and degrade its quality.
  </p>
  <h4>Fully Adjustable Sliding Desktop</h4>
  <p>
    The bike has a large fully adjustable 24”L X 16”W sliding desktop working surface with tilt forward, backward, up and down adjustability. It has 7 Desktop angle adjustment from 0 degree to 30 degree, 8 Desktop height adjustment ranges between 36.5” – 41”.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Desktop holds up to maximum weight of 44lbs, has two cup/accessory holders and a soft foam durable arm rest to increase the comfort.
  </p>
  <h4>Extra Thick Airsoft Seat</h4>
  <p>
    The Exerpeutic 2500 has a Large 3.3” Extra Thick Airsoft foam cushioned seat which provides extra comfort for long session workouts. The Airsoft Seat is large and oversized (17” L x 13” W), using aerodynamic healthcare technology allowing air to breathe through the fabric. The seat remains cool after many hours of use.
  </p>
  <p>
    It has an infinite seat slider position adjustment and can accommodate a user height range of 5’ to 6’.
  </p>
  <h4>3 Angle Adjustment Backrest</h4>
  <p>
    It comes with 3 Angle adjustable backrest to provide comfortable back support while exercising. This, together with the Airsoft seat at the base helps create maximum comfort for the user when pedaling.
  </p>
  <h4>LCD Computer</h4>
  <p>
    A LCD computer displays distance, calories burned, time, speed, odometer, and scan. Aside from these, the bike has a Bluetooth Smart Cloud Fitness that allows you to connect with any Android or iOS smartphone via the MyCloudFitness app which gives you the ability to set workout goals (for time, distance and calories), track your workouts, and much more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Burn calories and get closer to your fitness goals while you work, read, or enjoy a movie.
  </p>
  <h4>Transportation Wheels</h4>
  <p>
    Transportation wheels for easy relocation of the recumbent bike. This comes in handy when you want to put the bike away after workout or for storage purposes

  <h2 class="text-center">What To Lookout for When Purchasing an Exercise Bike – Buying Guide</h2>
  <p>
    Now the exercise bike presented above are one of the best bikes in the world, but if you feel they aren’t enough for you or you just wanna go hunting for other variety of exercise bikes in the market then no problem we have got you covered. Here are tips on the top things you should look for before buying an exercise bike.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now before we get to our tips, it is important you know and understand the types of exercise bikes we have in the market as different users will have their preferences on the type of workout that they need for their body. As such, it is important that you know the varieties of exercise bike that are available and the one which will suit your workout needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep in mind that some of the features you will see in this guide may vary across the different types of exercise bikes or might not be available in some, so it is advisable that you know the type of bike that will be best suit for you (in terms of comfort, aim and enjoyment) and your workout intensity by thoroughly going through the article below on types of exercise bikes
  </p>
  <h3 id="types" class="text-center font-weight-bold my-4">Types Of Exercise Bikes</h3>
  <p>
    There are generally three different types of stationary bikes: upright, recumbent, and dual-action. Each one offers slightly different benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
    Depending on your fitness level, joint health, and workout goals, you can focus on just one bike, or for more variety, you can try all of them at different times.
  </p>
  <h4>Upright Bike</h4>
  <p>
    One of the most popular types of stationary bikes is the upright bike. It’s similar to a regular bicycle, with the pedals positioned under your body.
  </p>
  <p>
    The upright bike provides a great cardio workout while also strengthening your leg and core muscles. Depending on your preference, this bike can be used for both standing or sitting.
  </p>
  <p>
    The downside of this bike is that the upright position can put pressure on your hands and wrists. Also, the small seat can be uncomfortable, especially for longer workouts.
  </p>
  <h4>Recumbent</h4>
  <p>
    With a recumbent stationary bike, you sit in a comfortable reclined position on a larger seat that’s positioned back from the pedals.
  </p>
  <p>
    This type of bike puts less stress on your upper body, joints, and low back. Your body is fully supported, which can make your workout less intense. You’ll also have less fatigue and muscle soreness after your workout.
  </p>
  <p>
    A recumbent bicycle is a good option if you have limited mobility, joint issues or injuries, or back pain. It’s also a safer option for older adults or those new to exercise bike. It doesn’t burn as much calories as an upright bike would, but it is superior in terms of comfort.
  </p>
  <h4>Dual-action Bike</h4>
  <p>
    A dual-action bike is the least like a regular road bicycle. It has handlebars that move back and forth to target your upper body muscles. So, while you’re pedaling and working your legs, you’re also able to get a solid upper body workout.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-center mb-3 font-weight-bold">Other Types of Exercise Bikes</h3>
  <p>
    The indoor cycle bike, which is the most popular option in indoor cycling classes, is similar to an upright bike but with a few differences. Their handlebars are farther away from the seat, shifting riders forward. Indoor cycles even allow users to stand while cycling, engaging more muscle groups in the process. As a result, indoor cycles tend to promote the most calorie burn from all the exercise bikes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another difference is that resistance is created with a weighted flywheel on the front, which is typically about 40 pounds. The resistance can be adjusted to simulate hills or riding into the wind.
  </p>
  <p>
    A less common type of stationary bike is a fan or air bike. This bike doesn’t have any preprogrammed options. Instead, you create resistance by pedaling.The faster you pedal, the faster the wheel blades rotate and the more resistance you generate. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words the harder you pedal, the harder the resistance. These bikes are generally less expensive than other types of stationary bicycles.

    <b>Note:</b>
    You might not see the complete set of features you are looking for in an exercise bike, or you might have to trade one or more off for another. This could be as a result of the budget you have planned or your preferences (Upright Bike, Recumbent Bike, Indoor Cycling or Dual-Action) in exercise bike.
  </p>
  <p>
    Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program on these bikes if you’re new to exercise, take medications, or have any medical concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
    Phew, Now that we have gotten that out of the way, I hope you now have some knowledge on the different types of exercise bike that are available and the one that may be right for your workout goals and intensity. You can feel free to do some more research on these types of bikes if it interests you.

  <h4>Flywheel Weight: Smoothness and Fluidity</h4>
  <p>
    The flywheel, in its essence, is a mechanical device used to store rotational energy. It is a heavy or weighted metal disk usually found at the front of the bike and it is connected to the pedals via chain or belt, much like an actual road bike.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you pedal, the cycling movement powers up the flywheel which rotates and stores up momentum that is eventually released when the spinning stops. The flywheel is linked to how fluid riding will feel and, in general, the heavier it is the better. When the flywheel is too light, you may feel jolts when pedaling.
  </p>
  <p>
    The flywheel weight that you choose will therefore depend on your goals. Are you trying to have a heavy high intensity workout routine or you just want to let off some daily steam, the former will require a heavier flywheel. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A flywheel of 7kg and above is recommended for standard bike performance. Although, some entry level and foldable bike (especially) may have lighter flywheel and still perform up to optimum standards. If you plan to exercise 2 to 3 times a week, you should consider a stationary bike with a flywheel above 9 kg.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a table to help guide you on your selection

  <h4>Resistance: Mechanical, Magnetic and Air</h4>
  <p>
    Resistance is what makes your riding harder when pedaling. They help increase the workout intensity and thus create a more realistic or real world riding experience. Generally speaking, there are 3 types of resistance system possible on exercise bikes: mechanical (or Direct-contact), magnetic and air.
  </p>
  <p>
    For <b>mechanical</b> resistance, direct contact with the flywheel creates friction which can be increased or decreased manually, usually by turning a knob. The direct contact braking uses the principle of friction to create Resistance.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is done by bringing the brake pads closer to the flywheel. They make contact and this creates resistance when a user pedals on the bike. As the resistance level is increased by the knob, the brake pads become further attached to the flywheel and this creates a higher level of resistance when a user tries to pedal. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This type of exercise bike is very accurate and lets you switch between the various resistance levels until you find one that is just right for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    The brake pads are usually made out of felt, but a number of other materials can be found in its place as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alternatively, friction bands can also be used in place of brake pads. They are simply fitted to the edge of the flywheel to cause the same effect of resistance.
  </p>
  <p>
    For all its advantages, exercise bike with direct-contact friction tend to experience a lot of mechanical abuse, which causes them to wear out over time. Eventually, the brake pads or the flywheel itself may have to be replaced. 
    Furthermore, due to the fact that the braking system is purely mechanical, direct-contact exercise bikes tend to make noise, unlike bikes with magnetic braking.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Magnetic Resistance</b>
     is relatively new to the market than mechanical. It is the most functional resistance system in the market and this is because it uses electromagnetic Induction to confer resistance on the flywheel. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Magnets are placed at different locations in order to create a Magnetic Brake pad. Unlike mechanical the magnetic brake pad does not make contact with the flywheel, instead it generates a magnetic field when it reaches certain proximity with the flywheel. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The effect of the magnetic field gets stronger (and thus creates more resistance is created) as the proximity of the flywheel increases.
    Changes with proximity can be made via buttons on the console and magnetic resistance works excellently with heart rate control and pre-set workouts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because the magnets and the flywheel do not have direct contact or touch in this resistance system, their parts don’t wear or tear. As such Magnetic resistance rarely needs replacement of it flywheel or parts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stationary bikes with magnetic braking have a very smooth, continuous resistance, which can be adjusted at the touch of button, and they are extremely quiet. In fact, they are quieter than both direct-contact and fan exercise bicycles. They are the best of the three and most popular
  </p>
  <p>
    Last but not the least, <b>Air or Fan-based Resistance Bike</b>; This system of resistance doesn’t make use of a flywheel instead a huge resistance fan is found where the flywheel would normally be. The fan itself is connected to the pedals via belt and pulley system.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Air</b>
    resistance works by your pedaling powering the fan which generates an air flow. The quicker you pedal the harder the resistance. One issue with air resistance is that it’s directly linked to your speed, so the only way to lower the resistance is to pedal slower. On the plus side, you get to feel the breeze from the fan which cools you down during intense workout session. In other words, the air resistance does have some sort of inbuilt cooling system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each of this resistance system is great and although we do have our favorite (Magnetic), I don’t think you can go wrong by selecting any one of them. This should purely be based on your budget.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exercise bikes that use a brake-based design are usually cheaper than magnetic resistance bikes. It is sturdy and simple in it construction, and while there is not much that can go wrong there you still need to maintain and replace some parts once in a while.
  </p>
  <p>
    Magnetic exercise bikes require less maintenance and make less noise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fan Bikes are a totally different topic on their own. They brought a totally different form of resistance into the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    So whichever resistance system you choose to go for, there isn’t much that can go wrong.
  </p>
  <h4>Console or Display</h4>
  <p>
    The console is where you can control your session and see your stats as you ride. It is also the region of the machine where you have the ability to select a workout program and alter the resistance (If it has a magnetic resistance). 
  </p>
  <p>
    Look for a clear display or console with easy-to-use controls. A good one will show some combination of your heart rate, calories burned, speed, revolutions per minute (RPM), resistance levels (if magnetic),and details such as time and distance. Try to get one with a backlit so you can see your reading even in the night or dark
  </p>
  <p>
    Another important feature of a console is Bluetooth Compatibility. A console with a Bluetooth can seamlessly be connected (via an app) to your smartphone, iPhone, iPad or tablet. This creates an easy to use user interface on your device, from which most or all of your console’s features can easily be accessed and controlled.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the things you could do on your device through this connection is creating new programs and customizing them, follow your training stats and progress, control the resistance of the exercise bike (if it is a magnetic bike) and even play video games.  This makes the workout more interactive, fun and thus more productive. So a Bluetooth in a console is definitely a thumb up.
  </p>
  <h4>Heart-Rate or Pulse Monitor: Handle bar or Chest Strap (Telemetric)</h4>
  <p>
    Many exercise bikes work a pulse sensor into the handlebars. You simply grip them firmly while exercising, wait a couple of seconds and then glance at the console for your reading. These are known as contact monitors. 
  </p>
  <p>
    They measure your heart rate only when you are touching them which can be troubling at times during workout. Especially during intense workouts when your body is constantly moving, placing your palm in suitable position for readings may be difficult during times like this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Those with a chest strap (telemetry) are best; they don't impede your movement like contact can. They are also more accurate and suitable for use
  </p>
  <p>
    Just in case the bike you wish to purchase doesn’t have heart rate monitors, they are Stand-alone heart-rate monitors available for about $28 to $100. You can also try wearing a top-rated fitness tracker with a built-in heart rate monitor.
  </p>
  <p>
    One common thing that happens when people venture out to purchase an exercise bike is that they get too carried away with all the fancy designs and whistles they find on the models on display. 
  </p>
  <p>
    While this is not a bad thing, as you will want an exercise bike that’s appealing to the eyes in your living room or gym, you should also know that you are making an investment and you wouldn’t want to regret it (which usually happens).
  </p>
  <p>
    Space is usually the last thing that people think of when they’re buying a stationary bike but there really is no point in investing in something that won’t even fit through the door or that might take up a huge space in your room just for exercise.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have very limited space or you just want an exercise bike that is durable and easy to handle around the house,
    then a foldable exercise bike might be just the thing for you. They are portable, don’t take up much space and are appealing for use in the living room. More importantly, they can easily be transported and packed for storage immediately after workout.
  </p>
  <p>
    These set of bike tend to be budget friendly, so you won’t have much trouble getting a good one to buy. They are also great for beginners
  </p>
  <h4>Non-Feet Slip</h4>
  <p>
    Being safe while you cycle is obviously very important. Make sure you're buying an exercise bike that has a secure base or leg Stabilizers. Non-slip feet will prevent your exercise bike moving around even if you're pedaling at high speeds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Floor stabilizers are great at the base for leveling to prevent the bike from rocking or tipping when cycling.
  </p>
  <h4>The Design</h4>
  <p>
    Take a closer look at the machine before purchase. You definitely want something that is appealing to the eyes, but at the same time make sure to take note of the materials the bike is built with. Are the parts in metal (more durable) or in plastic? And choose an exercise bike that will look good in your bedroom or your living room.
  </p>
  <h4>The Seat</h4>
  <p>
    Most users tend to have a problem with the comfort of their seat. In this case, the complain are they are not padded enough or they get uncomfortable after a long ride. Luckily this problem can be fixed by buying an extra seat padding or covering.
  </p>
  <p>
    On recumbent bikes, you should make sure both the seat and back support are well padded before purchased because they play a critical role here in this type of bike.
  </p>
  <p>
    While for Upright Bike make sure the seat can be adjusted vertically to be able to adjust it to the height of your hips as it will prevent you from hurting your back and joints. The horizontal adjustment is a plus but is not necessary. 
  </p>
  <h4>Adjustability</h4>
  <p>
    The height of the handle bar should also be adjustable on Upright bikes. This allows you to find an optimal position for your body during workout.
  </p>
  <p>
    For recumbent bikes, more attention should be given to the seat and backrest. Recumbent bikes are known for their comfort, so this is one part you wouldn’t want to play with. Thus, you should check to see that both the seat and backrest of the recumbent bike are easily adjusted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine a situation whereby more than one user is making use of the bike. Each of these individuals will have their own preferences so the bike will constantly be adjusted to suit their needs. It can be a problem when it’s your turn and you have to go through a lot of stress readjusting it every time. 
  </p>
  <h4>Maximum User Weight Capacity</h4>
  <p>
    You should check for the user capacity before buying, just to make sure the bike is enough to support your weight. This is especially important if you won’t be the only one using the bike because if there will be more than one user on the machine after purchase, the bike has to have a maximum weight capacity large enough to support a variety of User.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should know also that the higher the weight capacity, the more expensive the bike tends to be. The stationary bikes from middle and high range usually support up to 130-150 kg whereas the cheapest models only allow up to 90-100 kg.
  </p>
  <p>
    Generally, a weight capacity of at least 300lb/136kg looks good on an exercise bike. This is good enough to support the weight of a wide range of users and most possibly yours as well.
  </p>
  <h4>Safety</h4>
  <p>
    You should try as possible to keep your exercise bike away from Children, especially if you have a couple of them running around the house. Stats have shown that kids tend to be injured in the process of using exercise bikes. One solution to this would be to pack up and store your bike immediately after workouts. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A foldable bike will come in handy at a time like this as they are light weight and portable, making them easy to store after workout and saving you from the stress of heavy lifting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another solution would be to get a bike with transport wheels. A lot of them come with transport wheel nowadays. This makes them easy to move around and can help with storage.
  </p>
  <p>
    If possible you could also check out the bike parts and make decision from there. For example, you could opt for belts on the flywheel instead of chains or go for bikes which have critical their parts (such as the flywheel, chains or belts) well covered to prevent children from getting their heads, hands or other body parts stuck or harmed.
  </p>
  <h4>Drive System (Chain or Belt)</h4>
  <p>
    The drive mechanism is what connects your pedals to the wheels and transfers energy when in operation or pedaling to keep your flywheel moving.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are typically two types of drive system when it comes to exercise bikes: the chain drive system and the belt drive system. Others exist (gear dive, rope drive etc)
  </p>
  <p>
    These two are great for standard workouts but of the two the belt drive is the best. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As I stated above, you don’t have to have all of these features in your bike but you should definitely try to get most of them for a smoother and more effective workout. It all depends on your budget, and if your budget does allow it then get all of the features in your. Trust me it for the best and you definitely won’t regret it.
  </p>
  <p>
    While many biking veterans prefer a chain drive for its outdoor-bike feel, a chain drive is more likely to require more adjustments, wear down and break over time. It is also hard to maintain, you will need to lubricate your bike’s chain regularly (which can sometimes be messy). Sometimes the chain can break and will need to be replaced.
  </p>
  <p>
    The chain is higher in maintenance, but you do feel like you are riding an authentic outdoor bike which could suit your cycling experience. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A belt drive on the other hand is similar to the flexible belts under the hood of your car. They are often wide and have “teeth” that fit into grooves in the pedal system and flywheel.  As opposed to a chain drive, this type of belt drive produces less vibration during pedaling, which leads to a smoother pedaling experience and almost no noise generated.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is relatively maintenance free as it doesn’t require any lubrication nor do you have to replace it with a new belt.
    Because a belt drive allows for quiet operation it is much more family and roommate-friendly in close quarters or small-medium spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    For maximum durability and efficiency, nothing beats an indoor bike with a belt drive. Since its design isn’t chain-based, belt drives lack the weakening links that inevitably wear out on a chain.
  </p>
  <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Other Options and Accessories</h4>
  <p>
    Some other luxury features exist in addition to the basics mentioned above. They make your training as comfortable as possible and are mostly found on middle to high end bikes. They Include:
  </p>
  <p>
    Water bottle holders, smartphone docks and tablet holders which can keep your belongings close and within reach. Tablet holders can help you to visually follow certain workout programs while you pedal and water bottle holders help keep you hydrated during workouts. Some models can also include usb charging ports and fan systems to keep you cool during those intense exercises.
  </p>
  <p>
    Built-in speakers can also provide audio enhancement for a better music listening experience. Lastly, some bikes come with a TV installed just like some peleton bikes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exercise Bikes are a great tool to lose weight and keep fit. They are also great for Cardio workouts. So what are you waiting for, get an exercise bike today and start your fitness journey.
