    <h2>1. <a href="">Schwinn 270</a> – Best Recumbent Bike</h2>
    <p>
      Schwinn is a popular and reputable company when it comes to the production of Gym equipment. And I must say, they have made a name for themselves when it comes to the Production of exercise bikes in particular.
    </p>

  <p>
    So it is no surprise that the best bike on our list today will come from them. The Schwinn 270 is one the best recumbent bike on the market today. Despite the price value, this beauty still has what it take to compete with some other popular recumbent bikes on the high end.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Schwinn 270 is a big step up from the schwinn 230. Some of it key features include a 17-pound magnetic resistance system with 25 settings. The console computer supports four user profiles, holds 29 workout programs and fitness tests, has Bluetooth for data sharing, and is compatible with RideSocial “mixed reality” exercise videos. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Trust me when I say this bike is a beast.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make things even interesting, It has great adjustability, keeps you connected to the outside world with its media shelf and Bluetooth connectivity, and it has an excellent console with many workouts programs. Plus you can download your exercise data with this so you pick up the progress from where you stopped.
  </p>
  <div class="drawback p-3">
    <p>
      While the Schwinn is of course our favourite today and you definitely can’t go wrong with this beauty. It does have some little drawbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It isn’t recommended for tall people as it is too small for riders approximately 6 feet and taller. It also comes with a contact heart rate monitor located in the hand bar and while these are generally great for a standard cardio workout, they aren't always accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily this can easily be corrected by getting an external chest strapped (Telemetric) heart rate monitor. These are more accurate and reliable.

  </div>
  <h3 class="mb-4">Features</h3>
  <h4>Console</h4>
  <p>
    The Schwinn Recumbent bike has a great console which comes along with 29 Programmed Workouts. This is one of the main attractions of the bike. For the price the recumbent bike is valued at, this is quite impressive.  Some Bikes on the higher end don’t have this many programmed workouts. 
  </p>
  <p>
    These 29 Programmed workouts can be divided into: 12 profile, 9 heart rate control, 4 customs, 2 fitness test, 1 quick start.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 9 heart rate control programs is particularly impressive as they are good for Cardio workouts which is one of the reasons I cherish recumbent bikes a lot – Cardio workouts.
  </p>
  <p>
    The preset workout routines and fitness tests are shown on an LCD. The screen shows lots of fitness data at once, and it has an especially prominent “Goal” data field. This field shows progress in terms of distance, time or another primary workout objective. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The Console also support RideSocial mobile app and has a DualTrack blue backlit LCD display.
  </p>
  <h4>RideSocial Mobile App</h4>
  <p>
    RideSocial is a mobile app for Android and IOS (Apple) devices which seemly connects to your Schwinn 270 to give you a better workout experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    It can turn the Schwinn 270 into a sort of magic carpet, letting you virtually tour the world as you ride! The app lets you preview and optionally pay to download “mixed reality” bike exercise videos. 
  </p>
  <p>
    These high-definition videos can play on your mobile device or home entertainment system, letting you ride with street-level views in HD. There are numerous routes you could choose from and I am sure you will take a liking to most of them as each of their designs is unique. Some routes are filmed with VR 360 technology, so you can virtually “look around” as you ride.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bike app also creates a social platform as you can see avatars/bikes of other cyclers in those videos within routes. Meaning you could meet your friends also in cycling fantasy world.
  </p>
  <h4>Step Through Design</h4>
  <p>
    The bike is wonderfully designed, as it is very easy to get on the bike when you want to start exercise. And after you are done with your workouts, getting off the bike is no hassle at all. The low seat makes it very easy to move around.
  </p>
  <h4>Great Pedals</h4>
  <p>
    Along with its high-speed, high-inertia perimeter weighted flywheel which keeps this machine planted to the ground, its 3-piece pedal cracks with oversized pedals provide a comfortable biking motion for easy start up and smooth consistent workouts.
  </p>
  <h4>Comfort</h4>
  <p>
    The Schwinn makes no compromise in this area. It comes with a ventilated and contoured seat with padded seat bottom to keep you very comfy while you let off some steam. In terms of adjustability of the seat and Back support, there is an aluminum slider seat rail system with a quick and easy lever for fore and aft seat adjustment. The back lets air flow to help keep you cool.
  </p>
  <h4>300lb Weight Capacity</h4>
  <p>
    Although the flywheel of the Schwinn 270 is too heavy (about 17 pounds), it makes up for this part with its 300 lb maximum weight which allows for a large variety of users to make use of the recumbent bike.
  </p>
  <p>
    Coupled with the price at which this machine is out for sale, I think this is a very nice catch.
  </p>
  <h4>25 Level of Magnetic Resistance</h4>
  <p>
    25 level of resistance is available on the bike to suit the preferences of a range of users. Doesn’t matter if you are just starting out or an expert at cycling, just pick the resistance level that’s right for you. This wide range of resistance also help simulate a real world or outdoor riding experience.
  </p>
  <h4>USB Port</h4>
  <p>
    A usb port is included to charge your devices such as tablets, Phones, ipad e.t.c Thus creating room for some entertainment while you exercise.
  </p>
  <p>
    The USB could also be used for storing data, which can be uploaded to the Schwinn Connect website. The interface is also compatible with MyFitnessPal. That’s an app that integrates data from various sources to create a more comprehensive picture of workout goals, progress and activity.
  </p>
  <h4>MP3 Sound System</h4>
  <p>
    Exercising doesn’t have to be boring. Just to keep you pumped and motivated while you pedal, the Schwinn 270 comes with an in built sound system. There is an MP3 player jack built into the console.  Set it up and play some good loud music to keep you riding all the way. I should mention that a good music will help increase your duration on the exercise bike.
  </p>
  <h4>Media Shelf</h4>
  <p>
    The shelf is there to hold your magazines, phones, tablet and any other things or device which will help boost your workout session.
  </p>
  <h4>Three-speed Fan cooling</h4>
  <p>
    Just when I thought it couldn’t get any better, this baby comes with a three-speed fan cooling system. So whenever a day comes when you really want to do some intense body building workout, just know there is a cooling system installed in the bike to keep you refreshed while you sweat out some calories.
  </p>
  <h4>Water Bottle Holder</h4>
  <p>
    In addition to the cooling system, there is a water bottle holder present. This keeps you well hydrated especially when you are engaging in an intense workout. I mean, it makes sense since you will be sweating a lot and losing a lot of fluid. So it a nice idea to keep your water bottle nearby during times like these to keep you hydrated.
  </p>
  <h4>Transport Wheels</h4>
  <p>
    The Schwinn 270 comes with transport wheels installed, making it very easy to move around. This will come in handy when setting up the bike as will want to know which area in house or gym is well is well suited for the bike. And this will involve a lot of moving around.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is also great for saving space. There are times when you might not have the luxury of free space in your home, so you would want to pack up and put the bike into storage immediately after use. Assuming you perform your exercises on a daily basis, bringing your exercise bike from and back into storage can be very stressful.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is where the transportation wheels can be of great help. Moving your bike around the house becomes very easy with these wheels.

  <p>
    Recumbent bikes are often a common choice when it comes to exercise bikes, and there are no surprises there as to why this is so. Though they might not burn as much calories as upright bike, they are great for cardio workout and more than enough for a daily workout session. The Exerpeutic 900xl is a perfect example of an ideal recumbent bike.
  </p>
  <p>
    As Recumbent bikes should, the Exerpeutic 900xl help ease the tension on kneels and joints during working. It is also great for people with physical limitations, such as lower back injuries/pain or neurological conditions. 
  </p>
  <p>
    While still offering a challenging workout, recumbent bikes help riders stay very comfortable in a natural reclined body position with a seat that cradles the lower body and encourages better spinal posture. Thus giving a form of relaxation during workouts.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Exerpeutic 900XL is an entry level recumbent bike which is budget friendly and very appealing to most users. The bike might not come with a lot of fancy features, but it has just enough to make you break a sweat and ask for more. It features a sturdy design and a solid weight construction of 300lbs for smooth operation. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Another great feature of this bike is it silent operation which creates less noise in your workout environment and of course allows you to engage in other recreational activities such as listening to songs or watching exercise sessions on the TV which helps improve your workout.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Exerpeutic 900XL also comes with a heart rate sensor in the handgrip which enables you to track the intensity of your session. It has a step through design which makes it very easy for users to get off and on the bike during and after their session. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The heart rate sensors coupled with other cool features such as the oversized pedal and the large, padded adjustable seat help create an excellent cardiovascular workout session right in the comfort of your home.
  </p>
  <div class="drawback p-3">
    <p>
      Some complaints have been made on the adjustability of the seat. The knobs are not very flexible and thus this makes the bike very hard to adjust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course this might not present much of a problem if only a single person is making use of the bike. All you have to do is set it right the first time and you are good to go. But if they are multiple users, this can be a very tedious task as adjusting the bike to every user's preference each time they want to make use of it won't be easy.

  <h3 class="mb-4">Features</h3>
  <h4>Handgrip Heart Rate Sensor</h4>
  <p>
    Hand Pulse provides for heart rate monitoring giving you a great cardio workout. This is a great feature for this bike, especially since it is low cost. The heart rate sensor lets you know the intensity of your workout. That is you get to keep track of how much effort you are putting in and of course if you need to put in more or rather if you are already going at a great pace. 
  </p>
  <h4>Extended Leg Stabilizers</h4>
  <p>
    Leg stabilizers prevent any movement when exercising
  </p>
  <h4>Large Padded Seat</h4>
  <p>
    The bike may be low cost, but I must admit the manufacturers did put a lot of effort in the padded seats, both the one below and the one for the back comfort. Not only is the seat base and back support well padded, the seat is very large to increase the level of comfort while paddling. It also relieves your back and joints from pains.
  </p>
  <h4>Step Through Design (easy to get on and off)</h4>
  <p>
    Step-Thru design providing very easy on and off capability which results in a more effective and comfortable workout. This makes it easy for all users to get on the bike for use and when they are done they can get off the same way as well.
  </p>
  <h4>300 Pounds Weight Capacity</h4>
  <p>
    This bike comes with an extended weight support of up to 300lb. Thus increasing the scope of users that can make use of it
  </p>
  <h4>8 Level Magnetic Tension System</h4>
  <p>
    The bike also comes with an eight level resistance tension system. This makes it suitable for all types of cycler, ranging from novice to expert. The eight tension system can easily be adjusted to give a more realistic riding experience. As the tension level increases, the higher the difficulty during paddling and thus the more calories burnt during cycling. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition the Smooth torque” cranking system provides a smooth and consistent pedaling motion. These also help create a silent environment when working out which helps you engage in other recreational activities. 
  </p>
  <h4>LCD Computer</h4>
  <p>
    Well don’t expect to see anything fancy in this department. The exerpeutic 900XL doesn’t include workout programs and the likes on it console. However, the low cost stationary bike does have simple and elegant 3. 5” LCD display which is easy to read and understand. The large window LCD display indicates distance, calories burned, time, speed, pulse and scan.
  </p>
  <h4>Transportation Wheels</h4>
  <p>
    Transportation wheel also comes with this bike for easy movement during storage and for placing in the right spot when it time for some workout
  </p>
  <h4>Precision Balanced Flywheel</h4>
  <p>
    Heavy duty steel frame construction with extended Weight Capacity for stability and smooth operation. The precision balanced flywheel and V- belt drive provide a smooth and quiet operation

    The 400xl is a favorite of mine also, especially because of it foldable design and sturdiness.
    But I must say, Exerpeutic really did a great job with this new design. And honestly I shouldn’t be surprised, since they are a popular name in the exercise bike market when it comes to quality.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Gold 525XLR has a larger weight capacity than the 400Xl but the handle bar is shorter which some might not find comfortable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before we dive in, I want to address a question. What kind of bike is the Gold 525XLR?
  </p>
  <p>
    Now some people might refer to a bike such as this as a semi-recumbent bike and honestly that is not a problem. It’s common for people to refer to bikes with a design such as the Exerpeutic Gold 525XLR as semi recumbent. But don’t worry they are very similar in what they do.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personally, I think they are more effective in burning calorie than the classic recumbent and this bike is also foldable so I think it’s a two in one (a personal thought). They also provide you with a lot of comfort when riding which is great. However the level of comfort they provide is slightly lower from that of a recumbent bike but far higher than a typical upright bike.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are going review a similar variety of bikes as we go through this article which many like to call the desk bike. They are just like the recumbent bikes but they come with a desk attach to them which would be very useful for doing some work (eg typing), playing video games, watching movies etc while you exercise.
  </p>
  <p>
    The desk bike may also come with a semi recumbent design. I just wanted to drop some knowledge on this as we will be reviewing these bikes in our article as well. Now that we are done with that, let’s get back to business.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Exerpeutic Gold 525XLR is an innovative design in the industry. It have leg stabilizers(for stability on uneven surfaces) and a maximum user weight capacity of 400lb(extremely strong) meaning it can support the weight of a wide variety of users. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an ideal home recumbent bike since a lot of family would want to exercise. It is very cost effective, easy to use and can accommodate tall users since the seat can be adjusted to fit 5’2” to 6’5” user height.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the most attractive feature of this bike is it durability (it’s sturdy and well built) and folding design. Meaning it is meant for heavy duty use and very efficient in space saving which is not a surprise why a lot of people would go after a product like this, not only does it help you burn some calorie but it takes very little space for operation and can easily be folded for storage.
  </p>
  <p>
    It has a nice console display which is easy to read and understand. It also supports an 8 level magnetic resistance system which can easily be adjusted from the knob above the console interface. I mean, how cool is that? The knob is on the console(slightly above it actually).
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though the big is very sturdy and made with a lot of steel, it’s actually not that heavy. To top it, it comes with transportation wheels installed which makes it very easy for movement and storage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, the seat on this model is ergonomically designed for comfort and it has lots of padding too. It comes with a contact heart rate monitor on the handle bar. Plus the crank and transmission system of this recumbent bike are both made to be very smooth and quiet, thus providing you with a very enjoyable and silent ride.
  </p>
  <p class="caution p-3">
    Assembling the bike can be very difficult and time consuming.

  </p>
  <p>
    Note: You should remember that this bike isn’t totally recumbent (semi recumbent) so it should provide a lot of comfort with its large padded sit but the comfort shouldn’t be compared to that of a full recumbent bike 
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>

  <p>
    This semi recumbent bike has left a large foot print on the market, as there a lot of great review and demand for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bike is designed to support a weight capacity of up to 300 pounds(lb). It features 8 level magnetic tension control system, a high torque 3 piece torque crank system, heart pulse and a 'double drive' transmission system.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bike also has a foldable design, meaning it can be folded after use for storage or just for space saving. This comes very handy in times when you have little space in your home or environment to workout. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite the space-saving design, the 400XL is very powerful, with a precision-balanced flywheel and a quiet V-belt double-drive transmission system. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The eight-level magnetic tension control system makes it convenient for a wild range of cyclers to use so you can find the right resistance for your training goals. It won’t be a problem if you want an expert level workout routine or you just want to burn some calorie, all you have to do is adjust the resistance to your preference.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's easy to monitor your workout progress via the easy-to-read LCD display, which tracks your distance, calories burned, time, speed, scan, and heart rate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Best of all for frequent exercisers, the 400XL's semi-recumbent design is inviting and comfortable. The large seat cushion and backrest creates a comfy and relaxed sensation, making it ideal for people who dislike upright-style bikes, have back or joint pains and who are recovering from injury.
  </p>
  <p>
    The exerpeutic 400XL is truly one of my favorites. It comes packed with all these features that can transform the quality of your workout. To add, it does all these at a very affordable price. Trust me if you are looking for a recumbent bike for home fitness, this is one bike you would want to review.
  </p>
  <p class="p-3 drawback">
    While this bike does have a lot of wonderful features to go with it and it will generally be suited for a wide range of people when it comes to giving a effective workout, it is not really ideal for taller people.
    Especially if you are taller than six feet and two inches or so, you might find it uncomfortable working with this semi recumbent bike.

  <h3 class="mb-4">Features</h3>
  <h4>Comfort</h4>
  <p>
    While it doesn’t give the comfort of a full recumbent bike, the exerpeutic 400XL has all it takes to give you a steady, relaxed, comfy and effective workout experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite its lightweight and foldable design, the 400XL is sturdy and well built to handle the rigors of an intense workout without shaking excessively or being otherwise uncomfortable during normal use. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The ergonomic recumbent seat design does well at reducing pressure on the lower back and other trouble spots that frequently ache during long workout sessions on other machines – making it perfect for users prone to troublesome aches and pains. The large cushioned seat is adjustable to fit 5 feet 2 inches to 6 feet 2 inches user height.
  </p>
  <p>
    Together with its large seat, the bike has a double-drive transmission and balanced flywheel which both help to create a smooth and silent fitness session (you should know, this is pretty awesome). This allows you watch movies/TV while exercising or play some music, read magazines and engage in other activities that may help improve your workouts.
  </p>
  <p>
    It has heart rate sensors located on its handle bar. These readings however aren’t very accurate most of the times and as such should only be used as a guide to measure your fitness progress. A chest strap would have been more accurate for telling heart rate, but this doesn’t take the glory away from this beauty bike
  </p>
  <p>
    If you really want more accurate readings on the heart rate sensors, you could get an external chest strap (telemetric) heart rate sensor as mentioned above or a fitness tracker.
  </p>
  <h4>Foldable Design</h4>
  <p>
    Don’t have enough space in the apartment or gym? The exerpeutic 400XL just might solve your problem. The bike is very portable and is great for space saving. It can fold to at least half its size, so once you are done using it for workouts you can easily pack it up for storage. It has a folded dimension of 20 L x 17 W x 54 H inches.
  </p>
  <p>
    You could also place it at a convenient spot for your daily exercises. This shouldn’t be a problem as it takes up little space for operation and if you need to move to a new spot, the bike comes with transportation wheels for easy movement.
  </p>
  <h4>300lb Maximum Weight Capacity</h4>
  <p>
    The bike can support users with a weight of up to 300lb. This is a nice feature in an exercise bike as it allows a large range of users to make use of it, especially for home use where more than one family member is going to make use of the machine.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bike also has a step through design meaning it is very easy to get off and on the bike, thus providing a more effective and comfortable workout with its 300 pounds weight capacity.
  </p>
  <h4>Large LCD Display</h4>
  <p>
    It has installed an easy to read large window (3.3 W x 1.5 H inches) LCD display that indicates distance, calories burned, time, speed, scan and pulse.
  </p>
  <p>
    The LCD screen is 3.3 by 1.5 ins and is very interactive, you can choose to see just one measure or set it to scan through the numbers every 6 seconds by pressing the button below the screen. It doesn’t have any programs included however, so this might be a little drawback.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also has no back lit, so it might be hard to read under poor light
  </p>
  <h4>Ergonomic Pedals</h4>
  <p>
    The bike has large pedals which are well suited for any kind of user. The pedals come with safety straps to keep your feet well gripped or tightened in order to prevent them from slipping, especially during fast cycling.
  </p>
  <h4>Resistance System</h4>
  <p>
    The bike comes with 8 level of magnetic tension resistance. It suitable for a wild range of users, whether you have an intense workout session planned out or you just want something to keep you fit, the bike is well equipped for both.
  </p>
  <p>
    With 1 being the lowest and the 8 the max, you can scale through the resistance settings to find which is well suited for your body. These resistance system help simulate a real world riding experience, as they create the kind of resistances you are likely to find outdoors based on your settings and experience level.
  </p>
  <p>
    I should point out also that the resistance type is magnetic which means the parts do not wear out or will need replacement in the long run. The bike operation is also very silent because of this, meaning you could engage in other activities while burning your calories like watching TV, playing video games or music, reading magazines etc
  </p>
  <p>
    All at a very affordable price

    A customer once said “I like the fact that I can watch TV, do my office work and it is easy to move this machine around”. Another buyer commented on how quiet the exercise bike is saying “This bike is so quiet, I could probably cycle right next to my sleeping toddler and not wake him up. Exactly what parents need, since nap time is the only serious exercise time!”
  </p>
  <p>
    From these feedbacks you can probably guess how good the desk bike really is, but just to clear out some of your doubts lets dive in some more.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Exerpeutic 2500 features 14 levels of magnetic resistance, a large 3 way adjustable desktop for your comfort and an airsoft seat that will be comfortable through all your workouts. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The oversized airsoft super cushioned seat is an upgrade from its previous version (i.e the exerpeutic exerwork 1000 ). This allows users to exercise for a much longer amount of time on this machine without any discomfort coming from down there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another nice feature of the 2500 is the three-way adjustable desktop. Not only does it adjust vertically and horizontally, but you can also change the tilt angle on it- which would come in handy if you were watching a tablet.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also comes with two water bottle holders built-in just to keep you refreshed and hydrated while you let off some weight.
  </p>
  <p>
    The free MyCloudFitness app gives you the ability to set workout goals, track your workouts, and settings for time, distance, and calories. 
  </p>
  <p>
    With the combination of all these features and many more, the Exerpeutic 2500 Desk Recumbent bike let you carry out your daily workouts while you work, read, play games or enjoy a movie. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Think of it more as exercising while doing what you love to do best. So why don’t you get started on your fitness goals today with the Exerpeutic 2500 ExerWork Bluetooth Desk Recumbent Bike.
  </p>
  <p>
    I should remind you guys that this is a recumbent bike, which means less strain is put on the knees and joints when pedaling. The bike will also be perfect for people who want less pressure on their back during workouts
  </p>
  <div class="caution p-3">
    <p>
      The only concern I have with the exerpeutic 2500 is it 250 lb maximum weight capacity. This isn’t really a big deal as the choice of weight capacity depends solely on you and your weight requirements. 250lb doesn’t really leaves room for range of individuals, but if you do fit the size requirements and like fitness data tracking, the Exerpeutic 2500 is a good choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might also face some problems with the shipping of the stationary bike as the arrival date can be vague. If you are buying from amazon, you should be aware that the bike is shipped in two packages which could arrive on different days. Assembling of bike could be a bit of a hassle also. It could take up to an hour or more to assemble.

  </div>
  <h3 class="mb-4">Features</h3>
  <h4>Step Through Design</h4>
  <p>
    The exerpeutic 2500 is perfectly designed in such a way that makes it very easy for users to get on the machine for workout and off when they are done with their session. That is to say it is very easy to get and off the bike as you please.
  </p>
  <h4>The Resistance System</h4>
  <p>
    The Exerpeutic 2500 Bluetooth 3 Way Adjustable Desk Recumbent Exercise Bike is equipped with a manual magnetic resistance system. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It features 14 resistance levels which is great for a variety of users. The higher the level of resistance is raised, the more intense the workout becomes. This is great for both users who wish to burn some heavy steam and those who just want a light workout.
  </p>
  <p>
    The resistance system is smooth and also quiet due to the fact that the magnetic brake and the flywheel which are the elements that generate the resistance do not make any direct contact with each other and so therefore no friction is generated. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The magnetic brake pad simply emits a magnetic field around the flywheel when the latter is in certain proximity in order to generate resistance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Quiet Drive belt system allows noiseless and uninterrupted workout sessions.
    Adjustable floor stabilizers are also present at the base for leveling to prevent the bike from rocking or tipping when cycling.
  </p>
  <h4>Durable and Stable Steel Frame Construction</h4>
  <p>

  <p>
    This is a great semi recumbent bike with a desk attached to it for other activities that you may want to engage in while cycling (eg reading, typing, video gaming, watching movies and so on). 
  </p>
  <p>
    The machine is also very foldable for storage, easy to move around and requires little amount of space to operate. So if you do have little space to spare at your apartment or fitness environment, it will probably be a nice idea to check this baby out.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Exerwork 1000 Desk Station Folding Bike is not only an exercise bike but also you can use the desk top as a work platform for your laptop, your favorite book, iPad, Smartphone or whatever device you choose. 
  </p>
  <p>
    You might not even be thinking of working out, that’s the beauty of the bike, rather than sit down doing nothing you can just pedal while doing it. In short you burn calories as you sit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The workfit 1000 is one of the best workstation bikes designed by Exerpeutic which is a very reputable company when it comes to the development of fitness/gym equipments. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It features the state of the art high torque 3 piece torque crank system, heart pulse monitoring and a "double drive" transmission system. You can burn those calories while you work, read or just watching a movie on your tablet, cruise the internet, check and reply to your emails without changing your schedule or work routine. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The Exerpeutic 1000 Desk Station Exercise Bike folds easily and can be relocated using the built in transportation wheels. The benefits of work/exercise can improve your mental alertness, heighten creativity, fight depression, burn calories, tone muscles and just improve your overall well being. So why not do both (combine them) with the workfit 1000?
  </p>
  <p>
    It also has a storage drawer to keep your notepad, book, pens and other small accessories that might be needed while working. It has a foam armrest which is very comfortable and the seat very nice (or comfy) to sit on for a long duration of exercise.
  </p>
  <p class="caution p-3">
    The 8 level magnetic resistance does help make the workout stiffer, but if you are looking for a intense or heavy planned daily workout routine the workout 1000 might not be the best choice for you.

  <h3 class="mb-4">Features</h3>
  <h4>
    300lb Weight Capacity:
  </h4>
  <p>
    Patented X-Bike Desk and Exercise Semi-Recumbent Bicycle with durable powder coated steel frame construction. It can support up to 300 lbs / 136 kg weight capacity which makes it very convenient for a wide variety of users. It also has a step through design, meaning it very easy to get on and off the bike, providing a more effective and comfortable workout.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Magnetic Resistance:
  </h4>
  <p>
    An 8 level Magnetic Tension control system, allows the user to adjust the tension level for an easier or more difficult workout. The first two levels of resistance will not even be noticed to a person who is mildly fit, whereas the resistance levels 7 and 8 are quite challenging to anyone. This helps create a more effective workout and a more realistic cycling.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Large Cushioned Backrest:
  </h4>
  <p>
    Large 1.3" / 3,5 cm thick foam cushioned backrest (15.5" H X 11.3" W / 39,5 cm x 28,5 cm). Just to keep back relaxed while you let off some steam.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also has a thick large AirSoft seat with extra comfort and adjustable to fit 5' 2" to 6' 3" (1,58m bis 1,92m) user height. This leads to more circulation of air, and reduce the feeling of discomfort and stress after hours of cycling.

    LCD Computer:
  </h4>
  <p>
    A LCD display indicates distance, calories burned, time, speed, odometer, scan and heart rate.

  </p>
  <h4>
    AirSoft Seat:
  </h4>
  <p>

    Fully Adjustable Sliding Desktop 
  </h4>
  <p>

It has a fully adjustable desktop with forward, back, up and down adjustability for sitting or standing positions.  A 3 angle adjustments - 0°, 16° and 33° and 5 height adjustments  41" up to 45" (104 cm to 114 cm).

  </p>

  </h4>
  <p>
    3 piece 'high torque' cranking system provides a smooth and consistent pedaling motion; Coupled with the precision balanced flywheel and V- belt drive which provides a smooth and quiet operation. It will not interfere with watching TV or listening to music.

    Marcy is yet another company which has prevailed in the fitness industry for a while now and they definitely put a lot of value into their equipments.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I have to say, I am really impressed with this recumbent bike. The best thing I love about the bike is the design. It is very appealing to the eyes and it definitely something you could leave in your living room because its sure to draw a lot of attention to itself and you will be happy to show it off to your friends.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also love the way all the parts just fit together. It is very compact and durable. It has a step through design, making it very easy to get on and off when you need to exercise and when you are done, which is a very important feature in a recumbent bike or exercise bike. Just by looking at the bike, I sure even you can decipher most of its features.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are looking for an easy and convenient way to lose unwanted pounds and increase cardiovascular endurance the NS-40502R Marcy Recumbent Bike is the answer. Benefit from the same type of workout you would experience on larger and more expensive exercise bikes, but in a compact design.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    This Premium Marcy Product has more than what it takes to give you an effective daily fitness routine.
  </p>
  <div class="p-3 caution">
    <p>
      Unfortunately the bike doesn’t come with a heart rate sensor which is very heart breaking as a pulse sensor is a common thing in exercise bikes nowadays and they are commonly used to measure the progress of the fitness program, especially in cardio workouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don’t mind this drawback, then this beauty will be a great option to consider else you might want to explore other option on this article.
    </p>
    <p>
      If however you really love this bike (just like I do) and a pulse sensor is a must for you, then you might want to try out some external options such as getting a fitness tracker or a chest strapped heart rate sensor (these tend to be very accurate in measurement).
    </p>
    <p>
      Caution: Pulse sensors on exercise bikes should only be used as a guide to strengthen the effectiveness of your fitness programs and should not be used as a medical reference

  <h3 class="mb-4">Features</h3>
  <h4>
    Drive and Resistance
  </h4>  
  <p>
    The Marcy recumbent bike NS-4050R is equipped with a standard flywheel (fairly light). Its exact weight is not specified, but considering that the whole bike weighs only 69 lbs (31.2 kg), its flywheel shouldn’t be more than 20 lbs (9 kg) which is still within our recommendation. The flywheel is perimeter based which is creates smooth pedaling during operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bike’s transmission is made up of a belt drive system. This creates less vibration when pedaling which leads to a silent and smoother pedaling experience. Also, as opposed to a chain drive, a belt drive doesn’t require lubrication. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Designed to push you to your limits, this exercise bike features magnetic resistance with eight preset levels. The tension-control knob allows easy adjustment to conform to your target workout zone. It cycles you through the eight-preset resistance for any cardiovascular exercise routine. These resistance levels are great for a wild range of cyclers, ranging from novice to intermediate.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Solid Construction and Comfortable Seats
  </h4>
  <p>
    The innovative steel build is specifically engineered to reduce friction and to improve durability through enhanced abrasion tolerance, superior wear, and oxidation resistance, making it a great investment that will last you a life time. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The soft vinyl foam seat pads provide the maximum comfortability regardless if you are having an intense cardio workout or a take-it-easy cardiovascular routine.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Pedals and Foot Straps
  </h4>
  <p>
    The weighted and counterbalanced pedals with adjustable foot straps offer a smooth pedal for a comfortable and safe biking experience. The crank arms are also made up of solid steel for a strong control, but standing on them is not recommended though.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Transport wheels for Portability
  </h4>
  <p>
    Convenient transport wheels allow users to move the equipment around the house hassle-free. The compact high-end design makes it perfect for the living room, garden, or gym. 
  </p>
  <h4>
    Frame and Design
  </h4>
  <p>
    This stationary bike's steel frame supports a maximum user weight capacity of 300 lbs. It is 57" long, 25" wide, and 43.5" high. The heavy-duty construction provides stability, and the ergonomic design ensures that you get the best workout possible. Investing in your own bike is the perfect way to take your health and fitness to the next level!
  </p>
  <h4>
    Comfortable Foam Handles
  </h4>
  <p>

  </p>
  <h4>

    This bike could solve or be the answer to all of your fitness problems. It has a thoughtful design and is comfortable for users of different sizes. The seat adjustment accommodates various leg lengths.
  </p>
  <p>
    This gym bike is great for low-impact workouts. It supports your lower back with an ergonomically designed seat while your knees and ankles are put under less stress thanks to the smooth magnetic resistance wheel.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Marcy NS-716R has a built-in water bottle/Cup holder to keep you hydrated and refreshed all through your workouts. It has a preset tension-adjustment knob that allows you to change your workout level in a snap. With eight different magnetic resistance levels, there’s something for everybody, from the beginner to the workout guru.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mold-injected seat has an ergonomic design that offers enough support for proper posture and the foam-covered handlebars provide you maximum comfort and stability while you exercise, especially when you turn up the intensity! Each bar is made at the standard size to provide you with a smooth and hassle-free cycling experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    The step-through frame eliminates the struggle of getting onto the bike which is a good thing, especially in recumbent bikes as you would want to get most of your body sweats from pedaling and not from actually trying to get on the bike. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The bike is built to provide a steady workout plan for anyone looking to burn some calories or engage in some cardio workouts, recovery training and so on. The LCD panel tracks all the data during your workout: speed, distance, calories, time, and more, all easily accessible at the touch of a button. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The design of the bike is very appealing to the eyes, making it easy to place the bike in the living room or any suitable location in the house just in case you want to show it off to your friends. The transport wheels make it easy for you to move the entire bike around when you need to (especially in between small spaces) or when it’s time to put it in storage.
  </p>
  <div class="caution p-3">
    <p>
      There are a lot of good things about this bike, ranging from the design to it performance. The only concern I would point out about the bike is a lack of pulse sensor 
    </p>
    <p>
      Heart rate sensors are now commonly found in most mid-high end exercise bike and they play an important role in cardio workouts and can be used as a reference for monitoring the progress or quality of your workouts 
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: Pulse sensors should not be used for medical reference or evaluation

  <h3 class="mb-4">Features</h3>
  <h4>
    300lb Weight Capacity:
  </h4>
  <p>
    The bike can support a weight capacity of up to 300lb which personally I think is a great because it means it will be convenient for a wild range of users especially if multiple users will be making use of the machine.
  </p>
  <p>
    A bike with this sort of weight capacity is typically ideal for home use as most family members usually fall within this weight capacity
  </p>
  <h4>
    8 Preset Resistance Level:
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Marcy Recumbent Magnetic Exercise Cycle has 8 preset resistance levels. Increase or decrease the resistance by simply twisting the resistance knob. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you are a novice or an experienced cycler, there is a resistance level set in there for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    The higher the level of resistance the tougher and more effective the workout become, that is to say, more resistance more calories burnt.
  </p>
  <h4>
    LCD Computer Display:
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Marcy Recumbent Exercise Bike includes a user-friendly LCD Computer Display which tracks time, speed, distance, calories, and total distance traveled (odometer).
  </p>
  <h4>
    Adjustable Seat:
  </h4>
  <p>
    Adjust the recumbent bike seat using the adjustment seat knob. The inseam length (from the edge of the seat to the pedal) is approximately 28” – 34”. This allows the bike to be suitable or comfortable for a lot of users to make use of.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Comfortable Seat:
  </h4>
  <p>
    The seat and back pad have high density foam that is durable, yet comfortable. In use with the recumbent handles next to the seat, you can exercise in comfort for long periods of time. The bike also has bike has a step through design, meaning it’s easy to get on and off the bike when you need to work out and after you are done respectively. 
  </p>
  <p>
    You might experience some discomfort on the seat after prolong use of the bike, but thankfully this can easily be resolved by buying a seat cover or extra padding.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Water Bottle Holder:
  </h4>
  <p>
    Quench your thirst without stopping your workout! Keep your favorite drink in the cup holder / water bottle holder to minimize your break time. This helps keep you refreshed and hydrated all through your session and could increase your duration on the machine.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Transport Wheels
  </h4>
  <p>
    Easily move your recumbent bike by tilting the unit on to the transport wheels and pulling / pushing the unit as needed. This comes in handy when you need to put the bike into storage or in small spaces where moving the bike around can be very difficult.

    The cute pink coating stylishly covers the bike making it great for anyone who wants to get healthy on a great looking machine. Just tell me how you won’t look at a piece of beauty like this and not want to burn some calories.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Sunny Health & Fitness SF-RB1117 Folding Recumbent Bike, as the name suggest can easily be folded for storage. The semi recumbent design also makes it great for small spaces. It is light weight and can easily be moved around thanks to the transportation wheels built-in.
  </p>
  <p>
    The large comfortable seat will support your bottom while the backrest provides additional support during longer and challenging exercise session. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The safety handle bars and adjustable pedals are added for safety and the feet stabilizers maintain balance while you ride. The seat is also very adjustable when it comes to height to better fit your body and a wild range of cyclers that might want to make use of the bike.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sturdy machine supports up to 220 lb so you can feel confident as you pedal for challenging sessions. The high-density foam handlebars are located on the sides and front of the bike for added safety.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bike also has a digital monitor or console which displays time, distance, calories burned and scan. It might not be too fancy or have preset programs, but it more than enough to get the work done.
  </p>
  <p>
    I must say, SUNNY did do at excellent job with such a machine. I for one like the fact that it is lightweight, I mean how can something so small create such a power fitness effect on the body. That’s right, did I forget to mention that it comes with 8 level of powerful magnetic resistance. The resistance system helps create the steady workout routine that your body needs to stay fit.
  </p>
  <div class="caution p-3">
    <p>
      I do have to point out that the maximum weight capacity of this bike is 220lb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although this is more of a personal opinion and I totally feel that your choice of weight capacity should depend solely on your budget and your body capacity/weight. However, getting a bike with a maximum weight capacity of at least 300 lb would actually be a lot nicer. Not only will this have a higher chance of meeting up to your body needs, but they are also ideal for gym or home use as they are suitable for a very large range of users (which could include other family members).

  <p>
    The recumbent bikes above are well optimized to meet up to the fitness requirements of a lot of people and there is no doubt that purchasing one of these bikes can surely help you reach a milestone in your fitness goals or agendas.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, if you are not satisfied with the ones above or you feel that any of these bikes don't have all the features you require in one or maybe you just to go exploring yourself for recumbent bikes in the market. Then no worries, we got you covered. Afterall, sometimes we just like to do things ourselves to personally see the pros and cons of a product before investing.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is totally fine we got you covered. Which is why we at MAVNEW decided to provide some extra tips on "what to look for in a recumbent bike before buying", just to help point you guys in the right direction.
  </p>
  <p>
    But before we get to that, I would like to give a basic description or overview on recumbent bikes.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-center font-weight-bold my-4">What is a Recumbent Bike</h3>
  <p>
    A Recumbent bike is a type of exercise/stationary bike which places it users in a comfortable and reclined (as opposed to the upright position of upright bikes) position when pedaling. They are often recommended for people with lower back problems, seniors. They are good for beginners too as they put little to no pressure on the kneels, joint and back.
  </p>
  <p>
    It has a large comfy seat to keep you well cushioned down there while you pedal. It also has a full back support which is also well cushioned to eliminate the possibility of a sore back during workout. Both the seat and the backrest allow you to sit in a reclined or chair-like position when cycling. This creates a great and uniform posture when cycling which is quite different from upright bikes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recumbent Bikes do come with handles, but they are located below the seat (at the sides) and some might have extra in front. When you are riding an upright exercise bike, you need to move your body forward in order to grab the handles, but this can be a painful position for people with back and hamstring issues. On the other hand, when you are seated on a recumbent bike, you can fully recline against the seat, making you less likely to slouch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, because they are located below the seat, the choice to grip them is optional. You can hold them tight during your exercise if it feels right by you or you could free up your hands and look good while pedaling. With your free hands, you could also make the workout session more effective by engaging your upper body parts in some exercise or you could use them to work, read a book, hold a phone (or tablet) or text while pedaling without worrying about losing your balance. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Another great advantage is that you could simply sit back and watch TV which can encourage you to stay on the bike for longer without getting bored.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some recumbent bikes even come with desk (these set of bikes are also called desk bikes) where you could place or read your magazines and books when cycling or you could mount your laptops for typing, watching movies and playing video. Perhaps these are one of the reasons recumbent bikes tend to be more expensive than upright bikes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though they aren’t always recommended for heavy workout session, you could burn the same amount of calorie on a recumbent bike as you would on an upright bike. And guess what, you get to do this while staying comfortable and relaxed on the spot (best thing about recumbent bikes). In other words, you are less likely to get tire on a recumbent bike (than on an upright bike), meaning you could potentially burn much more calorie. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Recumbent bikes are also very good for cardio workouts and if used well will have a more significant impact on your cardio workouts than upright bikes.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is not to say any is better than the other. They are two top bikes in the market and they are both unique in their own way. Since the article is about recumbent bikes we spoke on their features only. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope that part was clear. You could make some more research on recumbent bikes and their health benefits if you wish to. Now let's move to those tips we talked about.

  </div>
  <h4>Comfort</h4>
  <p>
    This is one of the important features (maybe the most important) of a recumbent bike. Let face it, most of the reason people go for these type of bike is because of the comfort (especially on the back and kneels) it gives while cycling. It is also recommended for seniors because it puts less strain on their body.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I think it is only proper we pay serious attention to this section of the bike.
  </p>
  <p>
    First off, you should always check to see that the seat and back support on a recumbent bike are large enough and well padded before purchase. This is very crucial as the longer you stay on the bike the more your butt (pardon my tone) gets sore from seating and your back won’t be very comfortable after a while.
  </p>
  <p>
    So a well padded seat or back rest helps increase relaxation and encourages a longer duration of exercise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course there are times when we have to compromise on the seat padding. For instance, you see a bike which has a lot of great and important feature which you would love to have or you feel is needed for your daily workout but the amount of padding is quite low.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don’t worry this happens a lot, luckily there is a quick fix for this. If the bike is really a must have then what you need to do is to buy an extra seat padding or seat cover.
  </p>
  <p>
    But remember, only do this if the bike is worth it. There is no need moving around looking for extra padding for your backrest or seat when you can get them all at one go. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The bike should also be easy to adjust (both with the seat and backrest). If more than one person will be using the machine, it is likely that the seat will be adjusted a lot to suit their preference. So you wouldn’t want to go through much trouble readjusting this all the time 
  </p>
  <p>
    Another thing that adds to your comfort is the weight capacity. Always check the maximum weight capacity the bike can handle before buying it. You would want to make sure the bike is strong enough to support your weight. And if you won’t be the only one using the recumbent bike (maybe other family members or friends might also be using the bike) it is recommended you go for a higher weight capacity just so the bike can handle a variety of users.
  </p>
  <p>
    But keep in mind that the higher the weight capacity the more expensive the recumbent bike is likely to be. 
  </p>
  <h4>Step Through Design</h4>
  <p>
    A lot of people find this to be very important in exercise bikes. What “step through” means is exactly what it sounds like. A user should be able to walk over the bike or stand without any inconvenience. And he or she should be able to sit on it from that position (like they would sit on a chair) without any hassle.
  </p>
  <p>
    This will make it very easy for you to get on the bike when to want to exercise and off immediately you are done with your workouts.
  </p>
  <h4>Pedals</h4>
  <p>
    Pedals are very crucial in recumbent bikes. You wouldn’t want your legs slipping each time you cycle.
  </p>
  <p>
    A good, reliable pedal will increase your stamina and make your workout much more enjoyment, thus making you stay on the bike for a longer duration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now how do we identify good pedals, even without trying them on?
  </p>
  <p>
    They should be oversized and have safety straps to prevent your legs from slipping when pedaling. It is also wise to get one with a 3 piece crank system which is very smooth for movement and is less clunky than the one piece crank.
  </p>
  <h4>The Design</h4>
  <p>
    Take a closer look at the machine before purchase. You definitely want something that is appealing to the eyes, but at the same time make sure to take note of the materials the bike is built with. Are the parts in metal (more durable) or in plastic? And choose an exercise bike that will look good in your bedroom or your living room.
  </p>

  <h4>Flywheel Weight: Smoothness and Fluidity</h4>
  <p>
    The flywheel, in its essence, is a mechanical device used to store rotational energy. It is a heavy or weighted metal disk usually found at the front of the bike and it is connected to the pedals via chain or belt, much like an actual road bike.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you pedal, the cycling movement powers up the flywheel which rotates and stores up momentum that is eventually released when the spinning stops. The flywheel is linked to how fluid riding will feel and, in general, the heavier it is the better. When the flywheel is too light, you may feel jolts when pedaling.
  </p>
  <p>
    The flywheel weight that you choose will therefore depend on your goals. Are you trying to have a heavy high intensity workout routine or you just want to let off some daily steam, the former will require a heavier flywheel. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A flywheel of 7kg and above is recommended for standard bike performance. Although, some entry level and foldable bike (especially) may have lighter flywheel and still perform up to optimum standards. If you plan to exercise 2 to 3 times a week, you should consider a stationary bike with a flywheel above 9 kg.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a table to help guide you on your selection

  <h4>Resistance: Mechanical, Magnetic and Air</h4>
  <p>
    Resistance is what makes your riding harder when pedaling. They help increase the workout intensity and thus create a more realistic or real world riding experience. Generally speaking, there are 3 types of resistance system possible on exercise bikes: mechanical (or Direct-contact), magnetic and air.
  </p>
  <p>
    For <b>mechanical</b> resistance, direct contact with the flywheel creates friction which can be increased or decreased manually, usually by turning a knob. The direct contact braking uses the principle of friction to create Resistance.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is done by bringing the brake pads closer to the flywheel. They make contact and this creates resistance when a user pedals on the bike. As the resistance level is increased by the knob, the brake pads become further attached to the flywheel and this creates a higher level of resistance when a user tries to pedal. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This type of exercise bike is very accurate and lets you switch between the various resistance levels until you find one that is just right for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    The brake pads are usually made out of felt, but a number of other materials can be found in its place as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alternatively, friction bands can also be used in place of brake pads. They are simply fitted to the edge of the flywheel to cause the same effect of resistance.
  </p>
  <p>
    For all its advantages, exercise bike with direct-contact friction tend to experience a lot of mechanical abuse, which causes them to wear out over time. Eventually, the brake pads or the flywheel itself may have to be replaced. 
    Furthermore, due to the fact that the braking system is purely mechanical, direct-contact exercise bikes tend to make noise, unlike bikes with magnetic braking.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Magnetic Resistance</b>
    is relatively new to the market than mechanical. It is the most functional resistance system in the market and this is because it uses electromagnetic Induction to confer resistance on the flywheel. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Magnets are placed at different locations in order to create a Magnetic Brake pad. Unlike mechanical the magnetic brake pad does not make contact with the flywheel, instead it generates a magnetic field when it reaches certain proximity with the flywheel. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The effect of the magnetic field gets stronger (and thus creates more resistance is created) as the proximity of the flywheel increases.
    Changes with proximity can be made via buttons on the console and magnetic resistance works excellently with heart rate control and pre-set workouts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because the magnets and the flywheel do not have direct contact or touch in this resistance system, their parts don’t wear or tear. As such Magnetic resistance rarely needs replacement of it flywheel or parts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stationary bikes with magnetic braking have a very smooth, continuous resistance, which can be adjusted at the touch of button, and they are extremely quiet. In fact, they are quieter than both direct-contact and fan exercise bicycles. They are the best of the three and most popular
  </p>
  <p>
    Last but not the least, <b>Air or Fan-based Resistance Bike</b>; This system of resistance doesn’t make use of a flywheel instead a huge resistance fan is found where the flywheel would normally be. The fan itself is connected to the pedals via belt and pulley system.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Air</b>
    resistance works by your pedaling powering the fan which generates an air flow. The quicker you pedal the harder the resistance. One issue with air resistance is that it’s directly linked to your speed, so the only way to lower the resistance is to pedal slower. On the plus side, you get to feel the breeze from the fan which cools you down during intense workout session. In other words, the air resistance does have some sort of inbuilt cooling system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each of this resistance system is great and although we do have our favorite (Magnetic), I don’t think you can go wrong by selecting any one of them. This should purely be based on your budget.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exercise bikes that use a brake-based design are usually cheaper than magnetic resistance bikes. It is sturdy and simple in it construction, and while there is not much that can go wrong there you still need to maintain and replace some parts once in a while.
  </p>
  <p>
    Magnetic exercise bikes require less maintenance and make less noise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fan Bikes are a totally different topic on their own. They brought a totally different form of resistance into the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    So whichever resistance system you choose to go for, there isn’t much that can go wrong.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Heart-Rate or Pulse Monitor: Handle bar or Chest Strap (Telemetric)</h4>
  <p>
    Many exercise bikes work a pulse sensor into the handlebars. You simply grip them firmly while exercising, wait a couple of seconds and then glance at the console for your reading. These are known as contact monitors. 
  </p>
  <p>
    They measure your heart rate only when you are touching them which can be troubling at times during workout. Especially during intense workouts when your body is constantly moving, placing your palm in suitable position for readings may be difficult during times like this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Those with a chest strap (telemetry) are best; they don't impede your movement like contact can. They are also more accurate and suitable for use
  </p>
  <p>
    Just in case the bike you wish to purchase doesn’t have heart rate monitors, they are Stand-alone heart-rate monitors available for about $28 to $100. You can also try wearing a top-rated fitness tracker with a built-in heart rate monitor.
  </p>
  <h4>Foldable Design (optional)</h4>
  <p>
    One common thing that happens when people venture out to purchase an exercise bike is that they get too carried away with all the fancy designs and whistles they find on the models on display. 
  </p>
  <p>
    While this is not a bad thing, as you will want an exercise bike that’s appealing to the eyes in your living room or gym, you should also know that you are making an investment and you wouldn’t want to regret it (which usually happens).
  </p>
  <p>
    Space is usually the last thing that people think of when they’re buying a stationary bike but there really is no point in investing in something that won’t even fit through the door or that might take up a huge space in your room just for exercise.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have very limited space or you just want an exercise bike that is durable and easy to handle around the house,
    then a foldable exercise bike might be just the thing for you. They are portable, don’t take up much space and are appealing for use in the living room. More importantly, they can easily be transported and packed for storage immediately after workout.
  </p>
  <p>
    These set of bike tend to be budget friendly, so you won’t have much trouble getting a good one to buy. They are also great for beginners
  </p>
  <h4>Console or Display</h4>
  <p>
    The console is where you can control your session and see your stats as you ride. It is also the region of the machine where you have the ability to select a workout program and alter the resistance (If it has a magnetic resistance). 
  </p>
  <p>
    Look for a clear display or console with easy-to-use controls. A good one will show some combination of your heart rate, calories burned, speed, revolutions per minute (RPM), resistance levels (if magnetic),and details such as time and distance. Try to get one with a backlit so you can see your reading even in the night or dark
  </p>
  <p>
    Another important feature of a console is Bluetooth Compatibility. A console with a Bluetooth can seamlessly be connected (via an app) to your smartphone, iPhone, iPad or tablet. This creates an easy to use user interface on your device, from which most or all of your console’s features can easily be accessed and controlled.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the things you could do on your device through this connection is creating new programs and customizing them, follow your training stats and progress, control the resistance of the exercise bike (if it is a magnetic bike) and even play video games.  This makes the workout more interactive, fun and thus more productive. So a Bluetooth in a console is definitely a thumb up.
  </p>
  <h4>Maximum User Weight Capacity</h4>
  <p>
    You should check for the user capacity before buying, just to make sure the bike is enough to support your weight. This is especially important if you won’t be the only one using the bike because if there will be more than one user on the machine after purchase, the bike has to have a maximum weight capacity large enough to support a variety of User.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should know also that the higher the weight capacity, the more expensive the bike tends to be. The stationary bikes from middle and high range usually support up to 130-150 kg whereas the cheapest models only allow up to 90-100 kg. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Generally, a weight capacity of at least 300lb/136kg looks good on an exercise bike. This is good enough to support the weight of a wide range users and most possibly yours as well.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Drive System (Chain or Belt)
  </h4>
  <p>
    The drive mechanism is what connects your pedals to the wheels and transfers energy when in operation or pedaling to keep your flywheel moving
  </p>
  <p>
    There are typically two types of drive system when it comes to exercise bikes: the chain drive system and the belt drive system. Others exist (gear dive, rope drive)
  </p>
  <p>
    These two are great for standard workouts but of the two the belt drive is the best. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As I stated above, you don’t have to have all of these features in your bike but you should definitely try to get most of them for a smoother and more effective workout. It all depends on your budget, and if your budget does allow it then get all of the features in your. Trust me it for the best and you definitely won’t regret it.
  </p>
  <p>
    While many biking veterans prefer a chain drive for its outdoor-bike feel, a chain drive is more likely to require more adjustments, wear down and break over time. It is also hard to maintain, you will need to lubricate your bike’s chain regularly (which can sometimes be messy). Sometimes the chain can break and will need to be replaced. The chain is higher in maintenance, but you do feel like you are riding an authentic outdoor bike which can really better your cycling experience. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A belt drive on the other hand is similar to the flexible belts under the hood of your car. They are often wide and have “teeth” that fit into grooves in the pedal system and flywheel.  As opposed to a chain drive, this type of belt drive produces less vibration during pedaling, which leads to a smoother pedaling experience and almost no noise generated. It is relatively maintenance free as it doesn’t require any lubrication nor do you have to replace it with a new belt.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because a belt drive allows for quiet operation it is much more family and roommate-friendly in close quarters or small-medium spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    For maximum durability and efficiency, nothing beats an indoor bike with a belt drive. Since its design isn’t chain-based, belt drives lack the weakening links that inevitably wear out on a chain.
  </p>

  <h4>Safety</h4>
  <p>
    You should try as possible to keep your exercise bike away from Children, especially if you have a couple of them running around the house. Stats have shown that kids tend to be injured in the process of using exercise bikes. 
  </p>
  <p>
    One solution to this would be to pack up and store your bike immediately after workouts. A good way to do this would be to get a bike with transport wheels. A lot of recumbent bikes come with transportation wheels as they tend to be heavy. The transportation wheels make them easy to move around and can help with storage. So the transportation wheel are recommended, try to check for them when purchasing a recumbent bike.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another option would be to get a foldable recumbent bike. These babies are very portable, light weight and most of all very effective in exercising. They are great for moving around and they are very foldable. So it is a two in one package. Foldable bike are also great if you don’t have enough space in the house as they take very little space and can easily be packed once you are done exercising.  
  </p>
  <p>
    If possible you could also check out the bike parts and make decision from there. For example, you could opt for belts on the flywheel instead of chains or go for bikes which have their critical parts (such as the flywheel, chains or belts) well covered to prevent children from getting their heads, hands or other body parts stuck or harmed.
  </p>

  <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Other Options and Accessories</h4>
  <p>
    Some other luxury features exist in addition to the basics mentioned above. They make your training as comfortable as possible and are mostly found on middle to high end bikes. They Include:
  </p>
  <p>
    Water bottle holders, smartphone docks and tablet holders which can keep your belongings close and within reach. Tablet holders can help you to visually follow certain workout programs while you pedal and water bottle holders help keep you hydrated during workouts. Some models can also include usb charging ports and fan systems to keep you cool during those intense exercises.
  </p>
  <p>
    Built-in speakers can also provide audio enhancement for a better music listening experience. Lastly, some bikes come with a TV installed just like some peleton bikes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recumbent Bikes are a great tool to lose weight and keep fit. They are also great for Cardio workouts and put little stress on the back, joints or kneel. And they do this without compromising your fitness routine which means you get to stay relaxed while burning out some calorie.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what are you waiting for? Get a Recumbent bike today and start some relaxing workouts.
